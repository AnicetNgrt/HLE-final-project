"Driverless Cars are usually something we see in movies, specifically in futuristic or sci-fi movies. When we see these movies, we are in awh and we would love to have them. I mean who wouldn't want a car that could drive it self, but is it the best thing for us?

There are companies now that have cars that drive, for exmple Google and BMW. Google has had drvieable cars since 2009 and they have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but there is still a person in there that has to help out. Although the cars do drive them selves, they can not go through work zones or go around crashes, so the human has to come into play. BMW has a car that they call ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", this car can handle driving speeds up to 25 mph, but drivers still need to keep their hands on the wheel and when the car does not know what to do then vibrations go through the seat to notify the driver.

Humans have been driving for many many centuries and to think of a day where we won't have to do that anymore is strange. If humans don't have to drive, then they won't pay attention. If these companies really make a car that drives it's self through any kind of condition then what will happen if the car gets into an accident with another car. Will it be the humans fault or the car and say it is the car's fault, who will we blamn the company for promoting a safe car or the people who designed the car. Something else to look at in the situation is how much will the repairs will be?

In today's day in age when we get into a crash the damage is pretty costly and the hospital bills are not very pretty either. But we are talking about a car that drives itself, so it is going to cast way more to fix. You have to repair the body of the car and the the inside just like you do now but these cars can drive them selves by computers and chips. So how much will they charge us to fix the computer and the body?

In coclusion to my argument, no. I dont think we should keep making and testing these driverless cars. There is so much at risk and Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of drving on autopilot 90% of the time. That is not 100% so why are we still wasting our time and money on this. The cost for repairing these cars if there is a crash will go up and there will be law suits to the companies. These cars will not make it very long on the market, so we should stop now and continue makeing the cars that we have now safer and continue rebuidling and finding more things we can add them. ";0
"Dear State Senator,

In my honest opinion I dont even think that we should have a President. Presidents dont do anything other than make things worst for our country. What they do is maybe fix one or two things that the previous president did wrong but they add more problems for each president to fix so instead of trying to add more problems to us just dont do the job and give work to the government because obviously the government has enough time to make up lies and excuses on why things happen when instead the government themselves can do it, that way no excuses have to be made up.

It may not be my place to talk about the government at all because I dont know what they are talking about but honestly thats not the point, the point is that Americans are too dumb to realize when the Government is lying or even telling the truth because they can never hear the real truth everything is the truth to them but if you deep and deep and deep youll find more and more things that to get suspious and you question yourself but youll never get to know the REAL truth because our government is corrupted and they lie to us Americans every time there is misery.

"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about this thing where schools want us to pick our career by the time we're in high school. Like, I get it, it's cool to have a plan and all, but I think it's kinda stressful. I mean, what if we change our minds like, a million times? Or what if we're just not sure what we want to do yet? It's like, shouldn't we be allowed to explore and figure it out at our own pace?

So, I did some research and found out that some people who took nontraditional paths after high school ended up being super successful. Like, did you know that Mark Zuckerberg didn't even finish college? And he's like, a billionaire or something! Or that J.K. Rowling was a single mom on welfare before she became a bestselling author. Like, whoa. So, maybe it's not such a bad thing to take a little time to figure things out.

But, on the other hand, some people say that picking a career by high school can help us get into college and stuff. And it's like, I get that, but shouldn't we be allowed to explore our interests and passions first? I mean, what if we're good at something that's not even on the career ladder? Like, what if I'm really good at playing video games and I want to be a pro gamer? Should I just give up on that because it's not a ""real"" career?

I don't know, guys. I'm just not sure what to think. But, I do know that I don't want to be forced into something that I'm not sure about. Can't we just take a deep breath and figure it out together? Like, as a society or something?

So, that's my essay. I hope you guys liked it. Let me know what you think! 😃";1
"The rise of online education has brought about a significant change in the way students learn and interact with their academic environment. While there are many advantages to online learning, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of online education and analyze the impact of missed school days, weather-related school cancellations, and the comparison between in-person and online classrooms.

One of the main advantages of online education is the flexibility it provides. With online learning, students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which can be particularly beneficial for those who have personal reasons, health issues, or sports commitments that prevent them from attending school regularly. This flexibility allows students to balance their academic and personal lives more effectively, which can lead to better overall academic performance.

However, there are also some disadvantages to online learning. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for missed school days due to personal reasons or health issues. While online education provides flexibility, it can also be isolating, and students may struggle to stay motivated and engaged without the support and interaction of their peers and teachers. Additionally, weather-related school cancellations can also have a significant impact on learning, as students may miss important lessons or assignments.

When comparing in-person and online classrooms, there are several factors to consider. In-person classrooms typically offer more opportunities for interaction and collaboration, which can be particularly beneficial for students who learn best through group work and discussion. Additionally, in-person classrooms often provide a more structured learning environment, with set schedules and routines that can help students stay on track and manage their time effectively.

On the other hand, online classrooms offer more flexibility and convenience, which can be particularly beneficial for students with busy schedules or who live far from their school. Additionally, online classrooms often provide access to a wider range of resources and materials, which can help students deepen their understanding of the subject matter.

In conclusion, online education has both advantages and disadvantages that must be carefully considered. While it provides flexibility and convenience, it can also be isolating and may lead to missed school days due to personal reasons or health issues. In-person classrooms offer more opportunities for interaction and collaboration, but may be less flexible and more structured. Ultimately, the choice between in-person and online education will depend on the individual student";1
"Imagine a thirteen year old girl with anxiety and depression, so when she's around people for too long she has a panic attack. Do you think we should have that happen at our school? Extracurricular activites get kids active out of the classroom, but they're extra

NOT

neccecary. I believe that not all students should be forced to take an extracurricular activity.

Having fun with something you enjoy is a great way to spend your afternoon after school, but some students have loads of homework from honors classes, or they might have a farm to take care of with their parents. Another possiblity is that they have a job at Walmart. They don't have time for a production in theatre or playing this years basketball team. Even if there are a lot of kids who don't have something to do after school, it doesn't make it anymore reasonable to force them into something else to do. They may not have responsibilities, but we do. So why stress us out with more work when you can let us make our own choices.

Being anti-social can be a horrible mix with extracurricular activities since they make us get active with our peers, and that get bad fast. Some kids at this age are in a dark place of the mind, and most of those kids just can't deal with the stress of talking to others. So putting them in a scenario where they have to is not only wrong, but harmful to the student. They could have a mental breakdown, cut themselves, or even go to suicide over little things that people don't even remember. It's an act of terrorism to do any of those things, because it doesn't only hurts the person, it hurts the people around them or close to them. The last thing we want at this school is to make our fellow peers and your students feel stressed and traumatized.

Since we're having to stay after school now, we won't have buses to bring us home, and some of our parents aren't willing to get us either because they're at work or they don't have a way of even getting to us. If we were in highschool then maybe some of us could drive, but we're in middle school. Our parents might both be at work. We don't have public buses so we can't go home that way, and walking home is quite a stretch. We'd probably get complaints for parents about their kids waking home. The best thing you could possibly do is rearrange the bus system, but that's harder than it sounds. It'll all have to be this intricate set of buses, and I don't think you have the time to set that up.

I believe that we should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity. We all have things to do at home, we might possibly not be ready for the exposure, and some of us also don't have a way to get home safely without taking the school bus. Save everyone some trouble and don't make us do the activities.";0
"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system and is extremely dangerous and deadly, but is also the planet that most like Earth. The author of the article supports his idea that going to Venus is a great idea reasonably well, although he doesn't use that much information to prove his claim. The author states a lot of the dangers of going to Venus and then addresses his points of wanting to study Venus more closely.

The author tells the reader that many Astronomers are fascinated with Venus because some people have a theory that Venus was once like Earth. He states that in Venus's past it might have been covered largely with oceans and could've had life on it, just like earth. The author even states that Venus still has some features on it that Earth has such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author also decribes that Venus could sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. The author uses examples of technology that could help us research more about Venus, such as NASA's blimp-like vehicle which could allow scientists to float above the carbon dioxide littered atmosphere, but most of his points about technology wouldn't work because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, which would make most forms of photographs and videos ineffective.

The author of this article claims that Venus is worth the cost and risk just to learn more about it but doesn't support his claim well enough to presuade the reader to agree with him. He backs up technology that wouldn't work because of the atmosphere surrounding Venus and doesn't show ways how we can get past the deadly atmosphere without risk. The author doesn't show enough reason that scientist should study Venus besides that it might have closely resembled Earth in the past.";0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is better for the environment, it is safer, and it cost people less in the stuggling economy.

To begin, limiting the usage of cars is a advantage because it is better for the environment. For example, ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Duffer). It is sad that there is so much pollution in the air that car usage has to be stopped in order for the smog in the air to decrease. After five days of smog, congestion was down by sixty percent in the capital of France. Obviously, limiting car usage is extremely better for the environment.

In addition, the less you use cars, the safer your community is. For example, Heidrun Walter ""...walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chattering of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" (Rosenthal). Children coul not be wandering aroundif there were cars on the road. There are accidents all the time where children and adults get struck by cars even when they are trying to be safe. Obviously, if cars are not on the road, it will be safer for everyone.

Finally, limiting car usage saves people money. Actually, ""...Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Rosenthal). The less that cars are used, the less gas people have to pay for and so they will save their hard earned money. If people stop using their vehicles, then they will be more likely to sell the car, and then they will make money in the long run. If the trend continues, fewer and fewer people will use their money to buy cars. Clearly, limiting car usage allows people to spend less money.

To conclude, limitng the usage of vehicles as transportation is an extremely good idea because it is better for the environment, it is saer, and it costs people less money.         ";0
"Driverless cars seem like a very neat thing to have but unsafe. We never know what could happen having one of these types of cars. Yes they sound like a really great idea. It can do all the work for you as it says in the article ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves."" Which is really awesome but what if something happens and all that ends in something bad.

What if the car starts to have a malfunction and loses control. Who knows who would also be responible for the inccedent, like the author says ""who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" The driver may have to pay for the damge if they were to be responsible for the problem and that wouldnt be any fun or cheap. Also in the article it asks if it would be boring waiting your turn? So true though wouldnt it be boring just sitting there waiting your turn to drive? Aslo what if drivers are to busy on their phones and a deer pops right out and the car doesn't stop on its own. To put the car together manufacturers had to put so many sensors on the driveless cars isnt that a little to much? Last but not least theses cars can't drive through situations like traffic issues or navigate through roadwork. I do not think these cars are worth it.

How I feel about driveless cars is a no go. I don't think they should be sold to anyone. These people just never know what could go wrong with them. Very great idea just probably should stay an idea. They would need so much done to them to ever truly be safe for the people. It would take them many years to get to where they went them to be. Like they say ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" That's aways away to be waiting for them to come out, by then they'll have hovercrafts. ";0
"Nobody wants to give up a privilege that we, as americans, have had for decades. This privilege is vital to work, commitments, and leisure, so much so, that many of us can't imagine living without it. Driving is viewed as almost a basic human right here in America, but what we don't know, is it might someday be the bane of humans survival. Greenhouse gases are hurting our atmosphere dramatically, causing rising tempeture, melting ice caps, and more exposure to harmful Ultra Violet rays that the sun gives off. We as Americans need to lead the world as we have since the creation of this wonderful country and promote the minimizing of the use of vehicles.

Recently France's capital, Paris, has been expiriencing some of the worst air pollution in their history. In an effort to renew its air quality they banned driving for two days, for two different sets of people. As Robert Duffer said ""On the first day anyone who drove an car with a liscence plate ending in an even number was not allowed to drive, and on the second anyone with a liscence plate ending in an odd number wasn't allowed to drive. The only exceptions being if you drove a hybrid or had more then three people in the car. This is a great example of an effort to take the quality of life here on earth into our own hands. We as humans are responsible for keeping the earth a safe place to live and by billowing smoke into the air through cars, powerplants and anywhere you can imagine is not doing that.

In Vauban, Germany, there sits a small town outside of Freiburg, peaceful and tranquil, just as many other small towns, but different in one huge way. The town has given up driving! The city counsel has made street parking, driveways and home garages forbidden, making owning a car, a bit difficult. 70% of all Vauban's families do not own a car and 57% gave up a car to live there. These are exceptional facts because it shows how people are attracted to a clean society. No one wants the world to change, but it will greatly if we do not change ourselves.

Overall I believe that things will get very bad quickly if we do not make great strides in creating a happier, healthier world for everyone to live in without fear of an life changing event happening. The world must reconize that the problem is our greed and we must take responsibility in changing our ways for the better if we want our children to see the same beautiful earth that we did.    ";0
"About twenty five years ago from 2001, there was an object found on Mars. When our Viking 1 was scanning the planet to find a safe place for the next space craft to land, Viking 2, Viking 1 suddenly ""spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" The scientists at first, were excited, but then we realized that it was probably a common Martian mesa. We just assumed that ""this one had unusual shadows."" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.

Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.

Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was ""winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.

Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a ""cloudless summer day."" ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,"" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution. As Garvin went on to add, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" Garvin stated. The Middle Butte is about the same height as Face on Mars. These things are so similar, it is almost impossible to think that the Face was created by aliens.";0
"Everyone has either given advice or been on the receiving end, From what clothes to wear the mall to whether or not you should break up with your significant other. People tend to seek others advice and opinions when making decisions, but most importantly from multiple sources/people. Seeking multiple opinions is good because it can open a person's point of view, Help a person make better decisions in the future and even finalize the decision they will make.

Advice from multiple people with different opinions can open a person's point of view in many ways, For example; Contradicting opinions. Going back to the Mall outfits, Say person A loves your first outfit choice, Although person B dislikes it. You go back and try on another outfit. Now both person A & B love your outfit, Those opinions helped form a new outfit. The opinions of both person A & B opened your mind to new possibilities and ideas, In this case outfits.

Different opinions and advice can help someone make better decisions in the future. The different opinions from people can help change someone for the better, Help them make better decisions in future events. Examples can be someone peer pressuring you to try something marijuana, although multiple people tell you not to, stopping you from doing it. Only a person can make up their mind but other people's opinions and advice can stop them from going down the wrong path.

A piece of advice can help a person finally make up their mind. When making hard decisions there's a lot of self doubt, that piece of advice from someone trusted can help make up of your mind and finalize your decision. If a person is doubting them self, They will most likely ask someone for advice. It can practically be about anything, All you need is that reassurement from your best friend, Family member, Trusted adult and spouse.

Finding multiple opinions from different people good because it can help make a person open minded, help someone make great decisions later on and help someone decide what they'll do. Any piece of advice can be good for you, if it's from the right person. Don't put your trust in everyone, All the while don't put little trust in people. Asking for advice is a natural part of life and you shouldn't be embarrassed to, We all go through the same experiences.                        ";0
"to the editor.

community service for students should be only for kids who deserve it not for others.

but kids who want to do it should be able to do if they want to.

for those who don't should have the right to say no i don't want to do that.

but community service is a nice thing to do if you really feel like doing it.

you shouldn't be forced to do it though because we have the right to say no.

kids should be paid a couple dollars if they put effort into the community service.

community service is almost like labor cause people are working when they don't want to work.

so to make a kid work like that is almost like child labor.

only if people want to work then it wouldn't be labor cause it would be something that they want to do right. so if we kids do want to work we have rights we can say no.

community service should only be judged by the court of law not by schools.

anybody who has done community service before probably is use to it.

but people that are new to it might be a little scared. or maybe even not wanting to do it.

that's why it should be referred to labor because we don't want to do it.

so really if students want to be in on community service then that's fine but if not then they should not have to join. me i wouldn't go to community cause it might not be good for me to always worry about my sugar.

but if you ask me i might clean up a thing or 2 because i partly care about our world.

seeing carts in the parking lot and trash laying around its just sad and pure laziness.

so please everybody if you see trash or courts anywhere try to take them back to where they belong. if you see somebody pushing carts but not to where they belong please take the cart back or pick up other peoples trash so the world is 1 step cleaner.";0
"Hey, I'm totally stoked to be writing this essay! 😃 As an 8th grader, I know that school lunches can sometimes be, like, super meh. 😴 Like, I mean, I love pizza and burgers and all that, but sometimes it's like, can't we mix things up a bit? 🤔

So, I did some research and found out that there are some pretty cool ways to make school lunches more enjoyable. First of all, food safety is like, super important! 🧽🚫 So, we should make sure that the food is prepared in a clean and hygienic environment. That means washing our hands a lot, and making sure that all the food is stored properly. 🧹📦 Like, I know it might sound gross, but it's important! 🙅‍♀️

Another thing we could do is try some new alternatives to the usual foods. I know some schools are thinking about removing pizza and burgers from the menu because they're not as healthy as they could be. 🥤🍔 But there are lots of other yummy options we could try instead! Like, have you ever had a veggie burger? They're like, totally delicious and they're better for you too! 🥗🍔 Plus, they come in all these fun flavors like mushroom and black bean. 🍄🌽

But here's the thing, if we remove certain foods from the menu, there could be some consequences. Like, if we don't have pizza one day, some kids might get super hangry! 😅🍕 And if we don't have burgers, some kids might not eat their veggies. 🥗😔 So, it's important to find a balance and offer a variety of healthy options. 🥑🥗

In conclusion, making school lunches more enjoyable is like, totally doable! 😃 We just need to be mindful of food safety, try some new";1
"In today's world, it is often said that having a positive attitude is the key to success and happiness. However, I believe that this is not entirely true. While a positive attitude can certainly help individuals navigate through difficult situations, it is not the only factor that determines the outcome. In fact, there are many instances where having a positive attitude can actually hinder one's ability to cope with adversity.

One example of this can be seen in the case of breakups. When someone experiences a breakup, it can be incredibly difficult to maintain a positive attitude, especially when the other person is actively trying to make the relationship as difficult as possible. In these situations, it is important for individuals to acknowledge their emotions and allow themselves to feel the pain of losing someone they care about. By doing so, they can begin to heal and move forward in a healthier way.

Similarly, losing someone close can be an incredibly challenging experience. While it may be tempting to try and maintain a positive attitude in order to avoid feeling overwhelmed, this can actually make the grieving process more difficult. It is important for individuals to allow themselves to feel the full range of emotions that come with losing a loved one, in order to properly process and heal from the experience.

Furthermore, the prevalence of bad people in today's world cannot be ignored. While having a positive attitude can certainly help individuals navigate through difficult situations, it cannot protect them from the actions of others. In many cases, individuals may encounter people who are intentionally trying to bring them down or cause them harm. In these situations, it is important for individuals to remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves, regardless of their attitude.

In conclusion, while having a positive attitude can certainly be helpful in many situations, it is not the only factor that determines the outcome. There are many instances where having a positive attitude can actually hinder one's ability to cope with adversity. It is important for individuals to acknowledge their emotions and allow themselves to feel the full range of emotions that come with difficult situations, in order to properly process and heal from them.

"Driverless cars could be the step toward a new world and new gerneration.

The driverless cars are not always a good thing though, because people feel the freedom of driving and love driving.

People also could have driver less taxi cabs, because of that over thousands of people would loose there jobs as a taxi driver.

There are people who agree with driverless cars, because if they are on a long trip and they have been driving all night and they fall asleep, and with the driverless car they are still safely on there way to there destiantion.

driverless cars will change the world, but sometimes that is not a good thing.

As I mentiond before there are tons of taxi and bus drivers across the United States and the world.

Now imagion all of those people who are working to support there family, and now they get fired because the new driverless taxi or driverless bus came out and took them all out of the job.

People would not get to experience the freedom of driving.

Driverless cars are not the worst idea of all.

Think of it like this you are handy capped or just at an old age where you should not be driving with the driverless car it helps them get to there destination saftly, or even if you were driving and you were playing with the radio and there was an accident in front of you and the car took over and started driving.

Think of it as the back up plan incase something happens.

My oppinion on the driverless cars are split I mentioned the good and bad of driverless cars, but if I had to choose I would say I do not want driverless cars.

My reasoning is I love that feel of freedom, and the feel of the open road.

People share a connection with there car weather it be they proposed to someone in it or they had there first kiss in it or it was the first time they went to an amusment park, no mater the case you share a connection with it.

The invention of driverless cars take away that bond because you are not driving a computer is, so a person's bond with a car is as strong as a person's bond with his or here children or husband or wife.

Nothing can beat the connection a person has with there car.       ";0
"Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Well, it would make sense for teachers to make these summer projects to prepare students for their upcoming school year. Teachers designing the project allows for students to maybe remember some subjects they may have forgotten and it shows the students what they need to know for the beginning of the year and allows for them to teach themselves. Some people may say otherwise that student designed projects could be equally as helpful and less time consuming and allow students to be responsible for the time they spend on their work, I can prove otherwise, that projects designed by teachers are more helpful in the long run than student designed projects through examples of my Brother, friends and a personal experience.

The first example is my brother, who went to school and towards the end, he was ready for school to be over. Once it was over he started to forget things that he's learned after not using it for anything over summer and so he used to have summer projects from his teachers, although he never felt like doing these projects, it would always help prepare him for the upcoming school year and strengthened up some of the areas that became weak overtime. Since then, when school started he was already ahead of some of the other kids in his class allowing him to have a easier time throughout the beginning of the year. Some may argue that student based projects can allow students to work at their own pace but do the same thing as if it was teacher based. However, If these summer projects were student-based it would really never get done because students like to spend their free time having fun and so students would procrastinate and never work on it till last minute in which wouldn't help them learn anything.

Another example is my friends, who aren't big on working over the summer because they don't want to waste their free time before school starts. Usually, they spend their summer going to the mall, skate park, the pool and each others houses. However, once the school released a summer project from one of their teachers, they knew they had to buckle down and do it to get out of the way so they can have the rest of their summer instead of procrastinating and being behind everyone else when school started and not having much time to spend the rest of their summer. Some people may argue that student-based projects can be self managed and allow students to be responsible to buckle down to complete it too. Although, student based projects allow students to be responsible for doing it or not, the students who aren't responsible wouldn't put these projects as a priority to them and slack off and instead do what they want instead of trying to learn things that would benefit them throughout the school year, while teacher-based projects would make students buckle down and give them a deadline to turn these projects in when school starts making it a priority to work on for every student.

The final example is my own personal experience, I once had a student-based project for English where I had to read 3 books for English but it had to be books of my own choice and I could choose whatever books I wanted to read for the summer project and write what books I had to read down on paper. That was the whole project, and since I had a choice and could read whatever I want, I procrastinated because I didn't like reading and personally didn't want to waste my time doing something I wasn't interested in instead of doing what everyone wants to do during summer which was have fun. So, since I was able to choose my own books I chose books that I thought were interesting and easy and turned out these books were under my reading level and just wrote those books down and continued my summer. The books being under my reading level didn't help me in the long run because once school started we were reading books that looked ten times bigger and longer than what I was used to which applied more stress to me and made it harder to read these bigger books and also affected my vocabulary. Some may argue that student-based projects allow the teachers to not have to take responsibility for whether students learned anything or not because it also could provide practice in a life skill that is self-teaching which could be helpful in college etc. However, if teachers aren't held responsible for these projects, some students wouldn't be able to learn much compared to those who actually did the project during the summer, making the students who didn't try or challenge themselves fall more and more behind everyone else ultimately hurting their success within the school year.

It is important that students are given teacher-based projects to allow students to be taught or re-taught and make sure that students actually take the time to do these projects to make their lives easier. In the past there probably weren't a lot of teacher-projects in which made the students upcoming school year probably a lot harder than it should've been. In the future students who have had teacher-based projects could have a better chance at success in later life and can provide skills that can benefit them in later life. If teachers weren't giving out projects that they outlined and allowing students to make-up their own, the world would probably have a lot less successful people who are educated and self-sufficient, and hard working. In conclusion, teacher-based projects are more helpful and can change the intellectual level that children can have and can provide less stress for children and allow them to absorb more of what they're learning through out the school year.                 ";0
"When people ask for advice they will sometimes seek more than one person because, you can get different perspectives and views of advice from different types of people.

If you need relation ship advice with you girl/boyfriend, you would want to ask a person whos had a strong relationship with someone for a while or a couples therapist. Or if you need advice on what to do in life you would ask someone that knows you and is wise, like your parents or your best bud. But anyways enough with that, people seek multiple opinions because they will want to see what other people would do or have done, sometimes they can combine the pieces of advice and do something great, like fore example you could not only get over a work out a problem in your relationship but also increase the bond between each other. Seeking advice can help something and make it good but, why do that when you can seek more and make that thing great

People seek multiple opinions because they will want to see what other people would do or have done, sometimes they can combine the pieces of advice and do something great, like for example you could not only work out a problem in your relationship but also increase the bond between each other.

"The Electoral College vote is a somewhat a confusing process with the voter not voting for the president, but electors who elect the president. Many people think that this method is flawed becuase the people are not electing the president. On the hand people think that the Electoral vote keeps the race for presidency with a more clear outcome, than if they were elected by the popular vote. There are defiently two different arguments to this points with both sides involving good evidence.

There are many flaws that people bring up in regard to the electoral vote. One of these is that since the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, the electors could easily defy the will of the people. The most obvious fact about the electoral vote is that you are not voting for the president, but for a group of electors who then vote for the president. This is also unfair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they know will not win. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not even see the candidates, and people in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. In turn the elctoral college is unfair and outdated.

Though there are plently of things wrong with the electoral college there are still plently of good arguments as to why we should keep it.  With the electoral college vote there is less of a chance of a dispute over the outcome thaan with the popular vote, though it happened in the 2000 election. The electoral can also make the race more fair, because a candidate with more regional appeal can not gain more electoral votes by campaigning heavily in that area. The electoral college also can help avoid run-off elections like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. Overally the Electoral College vote is a way of electing a president without actually electing a president, that should probabley be removed so the people have more of a say on who runs there country.                                                    ";0
"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and with the ongoing pandemic, it has become the norm for many students. While some may argue that traditional classroom learning is better, there are several reasons why students should take advantage of online and video conferencing options for distance learning.

First and foremost, online and video conferencing options provide flexibility and convenience for students. With these options, students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially beneficial for those with busy schedules or disabilities. Additionally, students can attend classes from anywhere with an internet connection, which can be especially beneficial for those who live in rural areas or have limited access to transportation.

Another advantage of online and video conferencing options is that they allow students to stay on task. In traditional classroom settings, students can easily get distracted by their peers or the classroom environment. However, with online and video conferencing options, students are more likely to stay focused on the task at hand. This can lead to better academic performance and a more successful future.

Furthermore, online and video conferencing options can provide students with a wider range of learning opportunities. With these options, students can attend classes from top universities and institutions around the world, without the need to relocate. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have access to these opportunities in their local area.

On the other hand, not taking advantage of distance learning can have several drawbacks. First and foremost, it can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in the learning process. Without the structure of a traditional classroom setting, students may struggle to stay on task and may not be as engaged in the learning process. This can lead to poor academic performance and a less successful future.

Additionally, not taking advantage of distance learning can limit students' opportunities for growth and development. Without access to top universities and institutions around the world, students may be limited in their ability to learn from top experts in their field. This can lead to a less successful future and a lack of opportunities for advancement.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why students should take advantage of online and video conferencing options for distance learning. These options provide flexibility and convenience, allow students to stay on task, and provide access to a wider range of learning opportunities. On the other hand, not taking advantage of distance learning can have several drawbacks, including a lack of";1
"Should emotions come in the way of teaching? Some may feel uncomfortable, and some may think its nessasary.

With teenagers now a days emotions are very unpredictable.

There is many things to take thought into before introducing this 'Facial Action Coding System' in schools.

Teenagers go through many emotions during the day. In one hour they may feel tired, sad, mad, or even discusted. But then the next hour they may feel happy, excited, or surprised. The point is that students' emotions are very unpredictable. Yet I feel like these emotions should not get in the way of teaching.

Another thing that is very important to point out is that this approach might make students feel uncomfortable or even exposed. Privacy can be very important for some students. School is supposed to be a place where students can come and learn not have to worry about their emotions. That shouldn't be an excuse. Not all students have the same emotions, to make a plan that goes with every students' emotions is close to impossible.

However, teachers may find this approach helpful. They would know if the students are bored and they might be able to go about their lesson a different way. This would help to get the attention of the students and to keep them entertained. This approach would make it easier for teachers to connect with their students too.

Overall, having this approach in school in my opinion, isn't nessasary. Of course it could be helpful to get students more engaged in their learning, but this approach could also make students feel uncomfortable. It'll be very difficult to come up with a lesson to work with every emotion in a classroom full of develpoing kids. ";0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that learning how to fix cars and tune a computer for an engine, understanding basic physics and equations, and practicing playing shooter video games are all important skills to acquire. While these may seem like unrelated topics, I believe that they are all interconnected and can help me become a more well-rounded individual.

Firstly, learning how to fix cars and tune a computer for an engine is an important skill to have. Not only does it allow me to save money by doing my own repairs, but it also teaches me about the inner workings of machines. This knowledge can be applied to other areas of my life, such as understanding how to fix other machines or even how to build my own. Additionally, working on cars and computers can help me develop problem-solving skills, as I will need to diagnose and fix issues that arise.

Secondly, understanding basic physics and equations is also crucial. Physics is the foundation of many aspects of our lives, from the way our cars move to the way our bodies function. By understanding the principles of physics, I can better understand how the world works and make more informed decisions. Additionally, learning equations can help me solve problems and make calculations in various fields, such as engineering or finance.

Lastly, playing shooter video games can help me become faster and more accurate with reactions. While this may seem like a frivolous activity, I believe that it can have real-world benefits. For example, playing shooter games can help me develop quick reflexes and improve my hand-eye coordination. Additionally, many games require strategic thinking and problem-solving, which can help me develop these skills in other areas of my life.

In conclusion, I believe that learning how to fix cars and tune a computer for an engine, understanding basic physics and equations, and practicing playing shooter video games are all important skills to acquire. While they may seem unrelated, they are all interconnected and can help me become a more well-rounded individual. By developing these skills, I can improve my problem-solving abilities, save money, and become a more informed and coordinated individual.";1
"Students that play sports, are in clubs, and do things for the community are more likely to have more opportunities than kids who don't do anything at all. For example extracurricular activities help you get to know more people and socialize. They also look really good on college applications and might help you get a job in the future. They can also help you be more responsible. More students should do more extracurricular activities to have more opportunities and have a chance to try things they have never done before.

Being social and having friends is a big part of middle school and high school. Having the ability to do more clubs and sports can allow you to be with your friends and meet new people. By doing a club or sport that you really like you may find people who have the same interests that you have! The friends that you make can become your life long friends. If you get a job doing what you did in the clubs or sports you may be working with some of the friends you met while dong the activities.

Extracurricular activities look really good on college applications. Colleges want to see that you are involved in the school and community. they also want to see how many things you are capable of doing all at once. doing activities could also give you extra credit which really helps you get into more colleges. Also while you are in college you could countinue do play or do the activity that you were doing in middle and high school. You can also get a career in the path that your extracurricular activities went in.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also help keep you be more responsible. They can help by having to remembering your things for practice. Or having to do work outside of school for what you are doing in the clubs. being more responsible can be helpful with remembering homework. They may also help with keeping your grades up, because for some sports teams you have to have good grades to keep playing on the team.

Having to participate in exctracurricular activities will really benefit your life and life for the future. By getting to know more people and being involed in the community. Also by being more organized and having more responsibilities. Doing these activities will also help you get into college or get a job in the future. For kids who might not get the chance to do these activities the schools having them do it will help them have more opportunities.         ";0

Most of our development after World War II has be n centered  on the car or other means of transport. 80 percoent of laws have to highways and only 20 percent to other transport in the United States.

"Did you know that extracurricular activities can help you in many ways? I think that extracurricular activities should be prioritized more. For example, schools should help kids out by having them do extracurricular activities like a sports team. I agree that my principal should require every student to participate in an extracurricular activity so their brain can get stronger, they can have some physical fitness, and so they can have a safe place to go after school.

First, an after school activity could help students build their brain power and help it get stronger. In a extracurricular activity like chess club, the students could build their brain. In the chess club, students learn strategy and technique which are good life skills and helps build their brain. The brain requires strategy so it can do anything in the best way possible or the quickest way. Technique is also important to the brain so it can do things efficiently uniquely.

Also, certain extracurricular activities could help students get more in shape and help them learn fitness skills. For example, an after school weight lifting class teaches the kids good technique and how to get in shape. All students need good technique when lifting weights because otherwise they could get seriously injured. These type of classes also teach kids how to get in shape or stay in shape so they can live a healthy and happy life.

Finally, after school activities help kids have a few extra hours out of their toxic home or their stressful personal life. Some students come home every day wishing they could go back to school. These students come home to abusive parents or just siblings who act like bullies. For them in a extracurricular activity they could escape that and create family like relationships with their teammates or piers. The coach of the sports team also can act like a guardian type figure if their parents are never around or just don't care for them.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that the principal should require that all students should participate in one or more after school activities. These activities help every kid and every kid can find something helpful in a extracurricular activity. The kids who participate will live better and stronger lives.";0
"Luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. When his friend Don asked him to go on a cattle boat Luke couldn't say no. It was and opportunity of a life time and Luke knew it. In 1945 the World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins.44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Rlief and Rehabilition Administration).They hired seagoing cowboys to take care of all the animals. So Luke and Don signed up.

In August 1945,they received an order to go to New Orleans. They arrived on the 14th of August the day the pacific war ended says Luke. They got there papers and got a boat called the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed towards Greece. They were delivering 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Be for they got to Greece Luke turned 18 years old. That ment that he could be drafed at any time to go to war. When he told them that he was on a cattle-boatr trip they told him to do it for the Military Service. Luke had made nine trips that more then any seagoing cow boy has ever made.

The cattle boat trip was an alsome trip for a small town boy Luke say. besides helping people he also got to see different countries like all of Europe and China but when he saw Acropolis in Greece it was special to him Luke says. It toke Luke and Don abount two weeks to crose the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast that is a long time on water non stop that would make me sick and never ride a boat again but sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do.

When Luke was little he helped his aunt Katie's farm ou when he was a boy and he has worked hard ever since that is my dream is to work on a farm. It did not teach him the dangers of the sea though. When he was on his secened trip he was a night watchman. He had to check on all of the animals every hour and that was easy i bet because of him helping on a farm when he was a kid that was the same but it was on a boat. When he was reporting to the captin one time he slipoed and fell on the ground and a peice of meatal stop him from going over board.

So that was my eassy on Luke and his life I really liked this story alot i would have wrote more but i am about out of time so thats all i got. I found out that that peice of meatal craked his ribs so he could not work for a acouple of days witch that might of hert his body every day till it was helled but i do nt know because i am not Luke and that is the end of my story.

"School symbolizes education and the nurturing for those eager to learn. The commitment of developing your skills, like sharpening a blade, requires repetition of the knowledge that you have acquired through the source of education. If one were to divide themselves of this repetition they would not be able to grasp at what has been handed to them, education. A classic portrait of school is kids running around with pencils in their hand, discussing and disputing with one another to reach a conclusion. If one were to not be able to join this classic portrait they would not have the opportunities that were able to attend school and acquire the education they wanted. Though distance learning does have it negative aspects such as students not being adept to new technology, but this does not out weigh the fact that it is accessible for those that want to learn and the flexibility of distance learning; distance learning benefits students by having courses online enabling it to have a variety of paths to develop towards.

Distance learning has many challenges to face due to it still being in development. But it being at its early stages means that it is evidently going to have problems; although, if we were continue to iron out these problems it would be another tool/resource for students to use. The challenges that distance learning is facing is it greater than the standard method of education, how will it positively impact students, and does it limit the capacity for one to grasp the knowledge given out during class. Distant learning is a method of teaching that is able to reach out to students that do not have an oppurtunity to attend the common methodology of school which is commonly held in a classroom. If one that previously unable to attend classes being held in school and was now enabled to attend classes online would it not be evident enough of how effective distant learning is? It being accessible to anyone makes it a greater than the standard method of education; being able to reach out to students of all sorts disabled or not forms it into a resource that teachers and students can rely on. By reaching out to students who incapacitated to attend school regularly impacts students positively due to it being flexible and accessible for students. By bringing just a device and its charger a student now is able to learn anywhere that has Wi-Fi and an electric outlet. And the materials needed for distance learning is limited enabling students to not require any other resources other than laptop and it's charger. Limiting the capacity the teacher ability to teach is not a problem for distance learning its just the method of how a teacher teach in an online setting.

Having classes online presents a multitude of advantages for students and teachers alike due to its flexibility. If a teacher wanted to implement something to their class it would be just as easy if it were in school. Its advancement is not even done to completion. If we were to continue to expand upon its accessibility would present much fortune in the department of education as students with disabilities would have the oppurtunity to attend classes with other students in the same setting. The flexibility of distance learning and its positive future presents a new resource for teachers and students that would advance their effectiveness of learning and teaching, while students that are not able to attend regular school would now have to oppurtunity to do so. The benefits from distance learning outweigh the negative aspects that could be easily fixed with just a few keyboard strokes.";0
"As an average 8th grade student, I have been thinking a lot about my high school experience and how I can make the most of it. One thing that has been on my mind is how to graduate early. I know that taking online classes, summer school, and staying after school for extra help are all options that can help me achieve this goal.

Another thing I have been thinking about is how to bring up my overall GPA. I know that taking extra classes, participating in sports, and approaching teachers to switch courses can all help me improve my grades. It's important to me to have a high GPA because it will make me a more competitive applicant for college and other opportunities after high school.

I have also been wondering about the pros and cons of working during high school. On one hand, working can help me learn important skills and gain financial independence. On the other hand, it can also take away from my academic time and impact my grades. I know that I will have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of working carefully before making a decision.

Finally, I have been curious about our school's graduation policies. I know that there is a minimum GPA requirement for graduation, but I'm not sure what it is. I think it's important to know this information so that I can plan accordingly and make sure I'm on track to graduate.

Overall, I think it's important to be proactive and take advantage of the opportunities available to me in high school. Whether it's taking online classes, participating in sports, or working, I know that these experiences will help me grow and prepare for the future.";1
"Most of the residents in Germany have given up their cars.

Vauban's streets are completely ''car-free'', this means that no one except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on one edge of the community have cars. This movement is called ''smart planning.''

He can become a seagoing cowboy so can you. He followed his dream so maybe you should too. And if you do fallow your dreams I'm sure you will become successful and earn your way to the top. And if you don't choose this path I hope you still choose something like seagoing Cowboys and still make sure you fallow your own dream.

"Parents always want to make the best decisions for their kids, whether it is homeschooling them or enrolling them into an actual school. Many students would rather be enrolled into a school than to be sitting at home all day video calling a teacher. Attending classes at home would not benefit students because they would lack social skills, less help, along with not fulfilling certain academic skills.

One of the biggest parts of taking classes at school are meeting new people and making connections with people. Bonding with friends and teachers can make a big impact on a students life, and not having the ability to do that can make a difference. Without social skills even the smallest tasks, like asking for help or greeting someone, could be nerve racking or difficult. During school I have needed to ask teachers or friends so many questions, because I did not understand the unit. The ability for me to ask peers and adults for help is a great gift that I greatly appreciate in my life. Social skills have helped me in so many situations that I could not have done myself if I were to take classes from home.

Attending classes from home may be less stressful on students because of less distractions and less people, but there is very little to no extra help. Taking classes at home is only the student and the teacher on a singular call. There are not nearly enough sources to obtain help from when taking classes at home. Whenever I am in need of help I would ask my friends or ask the teacher and they would give me an abundance amount of sources for help on whatever I am struggling on. When home schooled it is different and there is limited amount of help provided. Everyone deserves the help they desire for classes and that is a benefit of kids going to school for learning instead of home.

Taking part in school is an experience that everyone should go though and grow from. School develops so many academic skill sets that students learning from home would never have. Not having these academic skills could hurt the students learning from home. In schools they all have certain rules to follow with how to learn and act around others. At home they may be completely different. Once they enter the world outside their house it may be hard on the students because it is entirely different. When I had advanced from middle school to high school I thought it was a hard enough transition. I cannot imagine going from home schooled into the real world. The academic skills at schools need to be brought upon the students learning at home so they can understand what everyone else does.

The benefits students would have learning at school over at home is not even a question. Schools provide so much in many more ways than home. Schools provide students with better social skills, academic skills, and more help towards students who are in need of it. Home schooling students may not be a bad decision for some kids, because of certain situations, like disabilities and mental health, but most schools have programs and certain teachers who are more than willing to help those students learn and expand more. Overall learning and taking classes in school is a much better decision than at home.";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME.

Today i am here to talk to you about our cell phone policy here at school. Everyone has there different opinion on it. I'm writing this to tell you mine.

My opinion is that we should be allowed to have our phones in school, and use them during lunch, or free times, but have them off in class. i think if we do this students will, or should have them off in class cause we get to us them any other time. if they do have them on in class, this privilege should be taken away. As a student, I would use my phone during lunch, and free periods. when I'm in a class, or not allowed to use it, i wouldn't use it because we can already use it at another time, and if we want to still be able to use our phones in school, i would not use it when I'm not supposed too.

Reason's why we should be able to have our phones in school:

- some students walk home, or ride a bus, in case of emergency, we need phones to contact someone.

- If allowed, to use phones, during free times, students wouldn't be up walking around, yelling across the room, and just be wild. we could text that person, and talk to them that way instead.

- if we earned the right to have our phones in school, we should be able to have them.

one problem would be, not being concentrated in class. i think that as long as you tell them they have to keep there grades up, and earn it, they can have phones. if only a few students haven't earned the right to have there phone in school, they can't have it.

things student's have to do to earn it:

- keep grades up.

- get good grades on test / quizzes.

- be responsible.

- don't get in trouble.

- do what your told.

- no punishments at home.

- listen to parents.

if all goes well, we should be able to have our phones. if it would become a problem, and was not working, it should be taken away. if a student is caught with there phone in class, they should get it taken away, a parent should have to come pick it up, and they can' t use there phone is school anymore. if they proceed to do so, it would get taken away, a referral should be given, along with detention, a phone call home, and a parent would have to pick it up again. thank you for taking the time to read this. i ask you to please take this into consideration.

thank you once again.

Sincerely,

"Studies have shown 60% of students are more stressed out then theyll ever be. In my opinion, I think all students shouldn't be required to participate in at least extracurricular activity. I believe this because students have lots of stress already to complete other work, and doing any extracurricular activity even if its just one can add so much more stress.

Millions of students drop out every year, because they cant handle this stress that comes with school. Research has shown more than half of these millions of student were involved in some sort of extracurricular activity. Almost all these student regret it now, but back then it was a savior.

Another reason they shouldn't be required to take be in a extra curricular activity is, because people have families and nobody wants be stuck in a club, or at practice while the rest of their family is eating out. It shouldn't require someone to ask them self if they should go to soccer practice or go to their aunts cookout. Extracurricular activities arent only stressful on the students who participate in them but its also stressful on parents who might have to take their kid to practice or pick their kid's up from school after a club meeting. Most single parents who have work cant even take their kids to practice and have to call a friend to take their kid.

There are millions of reasons why students shouldn't be required to participate in a extracurricular activity. Those are just a few I could think of right now. Thats why I think the rule that all students should be required to participate in a extracurricular should be removed. ";0
"Dear,

TEACHER_NAME

I believe children should be able to use and also bring there phones to school. Just for the fact if something happens on there way to school they would be able to call there parents and notify hem what happen. Or maybe after school they get kid napped and they don't got there phone what are they going to do. Like for example i bring my phone to school just in case something happens.

I don't think kids shouldn't be able to bring there phones. What if there parents needs to tell you something like come straight home. Then they would know not to stay after school. If I was the principle i would allow children to bring there phones as long as they don't use it in class. There are lots of reasons kids should be able to have phones the have calculators on them they help you do everything like check your email. Stuff like that there like a little laptop and also teachers have them why cant we.

Schools shouldn't care off of the little things. We text instead of wasting paper. Instead of going to the office to use there phones we could use are own. Its just lunch it wouldn't hurt any one its not like were in class. most kids would probably bring there phones any way I bet if they made it to were we cant bring or phones most of the kids would still bring them. It would probably make them bring it even more. Well any way its not really up to me but if it were i would go with phones out at lunch.";0
"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. It is simply a natural land form. You can find similar land forms on Earth. Also, why would NASA even want to hide the existence of aliens? It is simply illogical to think that it was made by aliens.

The Face on Mars may look like a mask or a face, but that doesn't prove that it was made by aliens. There are many landforms here on Earth that look like faces or animals. NASA has taken photos of it, and it is clearly just a mesa. Why would NASA hide the existence of aliens from us anyways? Considering that it ""has become a pop icon"" and ""has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years,"" wouldn't NASA benifit from the existence of aliens?

NASA has not covered up the existence of aliens. The Face on Mars is just a naturally occuring landform that happens to look like a face. It's fun to think about what would happen if it was an actual face or created by aliens, but it was not made by aliens. Anyways, NASA would be trying to prove that there were or are aliens there if it was actually made by aliens. They would benifit greatly if aliens made the face.";0
I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that she was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if she's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with her at that time of the picture you would never know how she's feeling. Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling. In conclusion I don't think the Facial Coding System will work to tell how a person is feeling.;0
"Title: The Pros and Cons of Adding One and a Half Hours to School Each Day

Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the length of the school day. Some argue that schools should add one and a half hours to the school day, while others believe that this would be detrimental to students and teachers. In this essay, I will present the arguments for and against adding one and a half hours to the school day from various perspectives, including students, parents, and teachers.

Arguments for Adding One and a Half Hours to the School Day

One of the main arguments for adding one and a half hours to the school day is that it would provide students with more time to learn and improve their academic performance. With more time in the classroom, students would have more opportunities to ask questions, receive additional help, and work on assignments. This would ultimately lead to better grades and test scores, as well as a more comprehensive understanding of the material.

Another argument for adding one and a half hours to the school day is that it would give teachers more time to plan and prepare for their lessons. With more time, teachers could create more engaging and effective lessons, which would lead to better student engagement and motivation. This would ultimately lead to better academic outcomes for students.

Arguments Against Adding One and a Half Hours to the School Day

On the other hand, there are also arguments against adding one and a half hours to the school day. One of the main arguments is that it would be detrimental to students' mental health and well-being. With more time in the classroom, students would be more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and burnout. This could lead to decreased academic performance and a lower quality of life for students.

Another argument against adding one and a half hours to the school day is that it would be detrimental to teachers' work-life balance. With more time in the classroom, teachers would be less likely to have time for their own personal lives and activities outside of work. This could lead to increased stress and burnout, as well as a lower quality of life for teachers.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the debate about adding one and a half hours to the school day is complex and multifaceted. While there are arguments for adding more time to the school day, such as improved academic";1
"How do you make friends along your life?

well, some friendships are made by internet, outside activities, and others by being neighbors for a long time, however, the most lasting and common friendships are the ones you made at school. Therefore, you spend hours, days, months, and years being socially with the people around you, but what if you don't want to attend to school, and decide to take classes from home?

At school, you don't only made friends and memories , you also earn and learn good advices, and you see different perspectives.

People who are not socialist tend to be ones who graduated by taking online classes; they don't know how to interact with people, because they had spent most of their life talking and interacting with their computers. Sometimes we are the cause why people rather to take online classes, we separate them by diseases, illness and mental problems, not a lot of students at school have the chance to receive help or talk with their counselor ;

this is one of the reasons why people doesn't want to attend to school, and choose online classes.

A lot of cases now days about why people decide to course home school are:

Pregnancy at early age: The girls who get pregnant while they are in High School either take home school or don't go study anymore, when their belly starts growing they feel ashamed, and they tend to quit school.

The Life of Generic_Name, a 17 years old High School student , who migrate 2 years ago from Guatemala. Generic_Name's teacher was talking about the online courses, home school and other online options, in order that Generic_Name can graduate on time, she was so excited about her graduation date. She had a problem if for some reasons she decided to take the online course to finish High School on time; she couldn't speak English. So, how could Generic_Name learn to speak English, sitting all day long in front of her computer?

This is an example of a problem that many students had to face, when they are forced to do home school.

In conclusion, students won't benefit by attending classes from home, here is one the reasons why ; I am a student and sometimes I don't do the work that my teachers assign me, knowing so well, my teacher can walk where I am sitting and ask me for the assign work. So, can you imagine the online courses, students can search their answers, be on their phones, or taking care of someone while they are taking the online class, so much distraction. ";0
"In Nick D'Alto's article, "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author suggests that Dr. Hung's new facial regonation would be useful for many things including using it in a class room to read stusdents' emotional expressions. I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions. In his article, he uses the Mona Lisa as an example, and I personally think that it was a good example to help show her conveyed expressions.

Dr. Hung invented the Facial Action Coding System, which helps identify the emotions displayed on the human face,and paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. If this technology was used in a classroom setting, I think that it could be used to help teachers understand if some of their students are enjoying the lesson. Or it could possibly be used to tell when the students are lying to their teachers. The Facial Action Coding System shows the six basic emotion that are associated with the movements of ones facial muscles. The basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can also identify mixed emotions.

Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday. For example, a friend could probably tell how you feel by looking at your face. But some people might have trouble describing what each facial expression means. Dr. Hung had oserved had aritists like leonardo who had studied human anatomy that had helped them to paint human emotions. Similarly, Professor Hungs Facial Action Coding System is able to be electorically stored with some information about human anatomty and emotions.

Lastly, there are fourty-four major muscles in the human face. For example. a muscle called the obricularis oculi pars palabraeus is the muscle that makes the crow's-feet shape around your eyes. Experts can tell a real smile from a fake smile by the way your mouth is moved. Facial muscles can help produce emotions, by the movement of your muscles. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, I think that teachers could easily figure out the emotions that their students faces are conveying. This coding system seems to be revelotionary to me because of it can decipher emotions and it could help many people such as students, teachers, and even the government.

In conclusion, I personally think that with the help of this technology teachers will be able to read into their students emotions better. Also, teachers would be able to tell if students are lying to them. The value of this technolgy would be able to help them read the facial expressions of many people with diasbilites who have trouble conveying emotions. I beleive that is this type of technology were to be used in a classroom that it would be a great help to many teachers.        ";0
"Have you have wonder if you could go to the store with out diving. In the world today technolgie has change and the world as change. In the world today people are scared or don't even want to drive. Most people say it's not possible to get a car to take you places.

Wouldn't be great to get a car that drives by its self. Google confounder Sergey Brin has been working to get cars to drive by them self so the driver don't have to drive. Sergey Brin said it would only half the fuel you use today, it will also make sure you will be save and it will tell you when you willl need to take over and drive yourself. People in the world today has been getting into alot of crashes and not following the rules. These cars will be so smart it will tell you when you have to take over it will also tell you when you need gas or other things in your car. These cars will be one of the smartest things you will ever see. Just think how smart your phone is, your car will be twice as smarter than anything in this world. The smart cars will stop you when you are about to hit something. Just think when you are driving and you get scared and don't know what to do the car will push the breaks for you and you don't have to worry about anything.

If people are worried about the laws the car will take care of it. Most driver today when they drive they do stupid stuff or drive very carful, but what if you get scared and you have no idea what to do. The new car will take care of anything you will ask it to do. Some people are saying whatever if i dont trust it if you don't trust it you will have control of your car still you don't even have to let it do its own thing. People can sill control it and do whatever you want like it was the same car. Mercedes and Benz, Adui, and Nissan plan to have cars drive by them self in 2020. They are still looking to see what all they can do but they think in 2020 that people today don't have to drive there cars anymore.

How would it be to be able to drive with even touching the car. The world has change so much and it is still changing today. We will just have to wait and see what 2020 brings to us.";0
"Winston Churchill famously declared, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” To research and reflect on the role failure plays in the pursuit of success means we must look to examples of people who have pushed through setbacks and eventually achieved success. For instance, many people have heard the story of Thomas Edison’s 10,000 attempts to invent the light bulb. Despite 9,999 failures, he pushed on until his 10,000th attempt brought him success. 

This demonstrates the importance of looking for lessons embedded in failures, and finding courage to keep working. To teach students the value of failure in relation to success, educators should encourage students to undertake projects or experiments in a low-stakes environment. With guidance, allow students to take risks in their learning process and to not be afraid to make mistakes. Through reflection, conversations, and feedback, educators can help students gain insight and tap into resources to try again, despite failing. Ultimately, it is these moments of resilience and perseverance that will allow students to come out on top and realize success.";1
"I believe that use of the Facial Action Coding System could make immediate impacts in a classroom setting. The idea of being able to see someone's inner emotions could show lots of value for teachers in the class. This machine, after being tested in the classroom, could be used to make even more accurate and in-depth machines that could go even deeper. All it takes is it starting off.

There are many benefits to having a machine that is able to accurately find someone's emotions. The applications in the classroom would help make the day for a teacher run smoothly if there was trouble with a student, or if there was something upsetting a student you could use this device. The value of knowing what your students feel could help mold a curriculum that would be the most effective for their learning. Paragraph 6 mentions that classes could have computers that could detect these emotions, and change the way the lesson is and mold it to work for that specific student.

There is no reason that the FACS shouldn't be implemented into classes. The FACS is just a more accurate way of processing and recognizing someone's emotions and feelings. We, as humans, are always performing this calculation every day, as listed in paragraph 5. We cannot tell every emotion in someone's face, as they could be hiding their emotions behind a fake smile, or hiding sorrow or sadness behind a snarl. With the FACS knowing the emotions of a student in class who is struggling could maybe help the student and teacher find a way to stop the struggle. There is nothing wrong with knowing a student's emotions so a teacher can assist them if they are struggling.

This understanding of emotions and the creation of lessons that could help with those emotions could help graduation rates for schools go up, and help the GPA or work ethic of a student to increase. These benefits all could come from knowing students' emotions as long as the FACS is put into a school's classrooms.

Some may be worried that the FACS could be unaccurate and tell wrong emotions, but claims in paragragh 3 state that muscles in your face also dictate what emotion your feeling. These muscles can also indicate whether your smile is real and you are really happy, or if your smile is fake and that your feeling something different. Trained psychologists and others in their respected fields have contributed to the FACS to try and help create accurate assumptions based on the muscle usage in a person's face.

The evolution and effectiveness of the FACS could increase with the help of its use in the classroom, and the readings could become more accurate and more beneficial to the teacher and the student. The FACS could be used in almost anywhere, but I believe that it would have the biggest impact in the classroom. The effect it could have enourmous, and all it would take is one computer software.

The FACS should be put in classroom, not only to further the research needed to help develop the software more, but to help students who may struggle with lessons in class. The FACS's ability to read emotion will benefit student and teacher when the time comes, all it needs is to find its place in the classroom.   ";0
"One of my most remarkable talents I have developed over the years is my ability to write. Since I was a child, I have expressed my creativity through the written word. I have always been an avid reader and my love for literature inspired me to explore the power of written expression.

Perseverance plays an important role in achieving our goals. It is the ability to stick to a plan and continue to move toward a desired outcome despite any obstacles and impediments that may arise. It is easy to give up when faced with a difficult task, but peristence allows us to see the journey through to the end. However, it is important to recognize that success is not always guaranteed. Family support is another key component of achieving our goals. Having the support of family can provide comfort and encouragement to keep going, even when times get tough. But, it is important to consider that family support can be both beneficial and detrimental to success. When mistakes are made, it is important to understand the difference between successes and failures. While it may be tempting to give up after a setback, it is important to learn from the mistakes and use them to make adjustments for the future. It is only through successes and failures that we can develop and grow as individuals.;1
"The use of technology has revolutionized the way we stay in contact with people. Nowadays, it is easier than ever before for friends, family, and colleagues to connect with one another from any distance. With the aid of technology, businesses and schools can communicate with customers and students quickly and efficiently. 

However, the convenience of technology has also had its downside. People may become used to being in constant contact, and thus may not develop important social skills that can only be acquired through face-to-face interactions. Also, as technology is constantly changing, some may struggle to keep up with the newest advancements. 

Overall, technology has had both positive and negative effects on how people interact with one another. On one hand, it has allowed us to connect with people more quickly and efficiently than ever before. On the other hand, it may also be detrimental if overused or not used with the proper care. As technology continues to be a major part of our lives, it is important to remember the value of traditional methods of communication as well.";1
"For me I'm not okay by techonology called the Facial Action System because that can't tell that you can describe people's emotion, For me i think we're the only one and are family who can tell what's are emotion we can't also tell what's other's people emotions and also if you really don't know that person you can't really say or red what's their emotions. Like example even we smile in front of people that doesn't express that we're really happy etc because sometimes people smile because they don't want to see other people's worrying for them so they're just choosing to smile in front of them. Like me sometime's if im with other people even l'm sad or angry, l don't what to show what's my real emotion because l'm just choosing to smile in front of them because i don't want them to worry about my emotion or something. The only people who can read or tell what's are emotion is no other than are parents because they know us better than other people. We been on their tummy for nine months so they are the only one who can really read or tell what are emotion.

""While looking in the mirror "" By looking in the mirror can't really explain or say what's are emotion are becuase mirror don't speak and it doens't tell your emotions. People use mirro just becuase they want to see what's on their face or if it's dirty or what, how they look before they go somewhere. Mirror just copying what were doing in front of the mirror like if you start talking ofcorse your twin face in the mirror also gonna start talking too,becuase mirror is just a piece of a glass that can't describe what's people's emotion. Mirror can copy what were doing but can't say what are emotion or feeling.

"The Advantages and Disadvantages of Online High School Classes

In recent years, online high school classes have become increasingly popular. While some students may prefer the traditional classroom setting, there are several benefits to online classes that should be considered. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of online high school classes and examine the options available for students who are academically advanced and those who need extra help with their classes.

One of the main advantages of online high school classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which is particularly beneficial for those who have other commitments such as sports or extracurricular activities. Additionally, online classes often offer a wider range of courses than traditional classrooms, allowing students to pursue their interests and passions.

However, there are also several disadvantages to online high school classes. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. This can make it difficult for students to ask questions and receive feedback on their work. Additionally, online classes often require a high level of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging for some students.

Options for Advanced and Struggling Students

For students who are academically advanced, online classes can offer a more challenging and engaging learning experience. These classes often offer more advanced coursework and opportunities for independent study. On the other hand, for students who are struggling with their classes, online classes can offer extra support and resources. These classes often offer more individualized attention from teachers and additional resources such as online tutoring and study guides.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Middle School Classes

The decision to offer online middle school classes is a complex one. On the one hand, online classes can offer the same benefits as those for high school students, including flexibility and a wider range of courses. However, middle school students may not be mature enough to handle the self-discipline and responsibility required for online classes. Additionally, online classes may not offer the same level of social interaction as traditional classrooms, which is particularly important for middle school students who are developing their social skills.

Benefits of Online College Classes

For college students, online classes offer several benefits. These include flexibility, which can be particularly beneficial for students who are juggling other commitments such";1
"Many people participate in after school activities. Choosing to do so but some people prefer going home and resting after the long school day. But what if your principal said you have to participate in an extracurricular activity in order to go to this school. This may help you in many ways it could provide a way to talk and socialize with friends or make new ones. If it was a sport that involves any type of moving it would make you more fit and healthy. I would agree with the principals idea it introduces the kids to many things they have not done before and they might not of known they liked it or were good at it.

There are many benefits in extracurricular activities that you might not of known. Whether it would help you now or in the future. It is very healthy to participate in any activity because it can help you physically and even mentally improving your ability with your social skills in the result of you talking with your teammates or other people constantly. And how it can help you physically is in basically any sport you play. Your moving around constantly improving your endurance and strength it makes you more fit and healthy.

While there are many advantages with this idea every idea comes with some disadvantages. But I have ways to counter them. Some people are not as fortunate as us and many sports have a fee to sign up as a result to that some families might not be able to afford that fee. So the school fills that gap from the cliff stopping that student from participating offering many activities that do not require a fee or any sort of paying. And if they do the school can fill that gap with the extra money they have, you can even donate to the school so the school can keep providing their students with the money they need in order to sign up.

A lot of sports have practices almost every night and it might last until 9:00. So when you get home your exhausted and you don't feel like doing your homework or any project thats due soon. And its hard to find the time to do it. In the result of that the school makes the study halls or resources longer so you have time to finish your homework, essay, or school project. This will take the stress off of the students and let them sleep for a healthy amount of time instead of staying up late trying to finish that project.

the after school activity does not have to be a sport. It could be volunteering for school council or fighting for the the best design of the yearbook. This also comes with a lot of benefits. Designing the year book is not an easy task trying to make the best possible one making you use your imagination as hard as you ever had making the most unique and creative one. So the judges would select yours as the winner. And volunteering for student council is just as hard to trying to satisfy all of the students needs and opinions making ideas that are mature but also good this makes you think out of the box and your comfort zone.

Overall the principles Idea is a very good one that will improve the liveliness of the school. Making every student active is very important because it improves their mental health and physicall health. It will also help the students in the future providing scholarships for them to big colleges and programs. Making them feel more comfortable in front of bigger crowds. Students might not like the principles idea now but will thank him a couple years down the road.";0
"Dear State Senator,

Ever since our founding fathers established in the constitution that the president and vice president votes were determined by electoral college, the founding fathers made a good decision. Electoral College is a process where electors gather for a meeting and count the electoral votes to determine the new president and vice president. The United States should keep Electoral College to determine the president and vice president rather than a popular vote because Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote.

To start off, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than popular votes because electoral college avoids run-off elections. If somebody was running for either president or vice president and they recieved thirty percent in popular votes, nobody would know if the person with thirty percent popular vote would win the election. Electoral College prevents confusion by producing a clear winner. For example, in source 3, the text reads ""Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992 had only forty-three percent of popular votes but both had three-hundred and plus electoral votes which made them win the election"". The president and vice president make sure our country is running well and that we as a country have no problems. If we were to determine our president and vice president by a popular vote, whoever could kiss up more to the voters would win the election even if the person running doesn't meet up to the qualifacations of the person they are running against. Avoiding a run-off election is very important because no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Also, if a popular vote was how the president and vice president were decided, not as much people would pay attention to voting because voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign of the people running for president and vice president.

Furthermore, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than a popular vote because Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote. In 2008 when Barack Obama won his election to become the 44th president of the United States, he didn't win by being the popular canadite, Obama won by his passion to make this country better than it already is. For example, in source 1, the text reads ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president"". That way of electing the president is more fair than a popular vote because you need 270 electors to say yes to make you president rather than people making you president by if your popular or not. Electoral College is what keeps our elections fair. There is no other way to elect somebody president becuase no other method will be this successful than Electoral College. After all, Electoral College has been the way to elect the president since the constitution was created. Popular Voting is a bad method if were used to determine the president and vice president because somebody who is running for president can manipulate people to think he or she is a good canidate for president when they really aren't.

To conclude, Electoral College should continue to decide the president rather than popular votes becuase Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than popular votes. Why should we change the way we elect president if this method has been working for over 200 years? Electoral College should continue to decide the presidency for years to come because it works so well. That's why Electoral College will stay as the way to elect the president.

oes being home school damage students education? Yes, because most home school students social skills isn't well develop, being at home can be an distraction to their education, and limits educational activities.

After high school in the real world social skills are the key to having a successful life, everywhere you go people are going to be around. High school is suppose to guide students on the right path of a successful life, teaching students how to properly save and spend money, being responsible by turning your work in on time, and much more skills you need in the real world. Being home school may hurt someone social life which effects the social skills being develop, someone not having a social life could be depressing and lonely. Getting a job could be exhausting at times if someone doesn't know how to communicate properly, the first interviews are the most uncomfortable situation. Because the hiring manger wants someone who knows how to work well with people, being able to communicate with your boss and employees are very important.

However home school students could get distracted from school work easier than a student being distracted in school. Cellphones are the biggest distraction in society right now, you could be on your phone for hours and not know it. For not being around teachers physical it's harder for students to stay on task, teachers constantly have to remind students to behave, and do their work. Do you really believe a home school student can stay on task all the time? It's impossible for a teen to not get a little distracted, especially being home all day. Teens have their televisions and cellphones, being at school limits students to watch televisions or be on their phones.

School open eyes to many students trying to find themselves through educational activities, music, sports, art, and clubs. In schools you always have an option of trying something new, because of the verity of things in school to pick from. Also, determent the liking of something that could become into a future career. Being home school limits that experience yes, you could find something of your liking out of school. But its easier when all these options are at one place.

Therefore being home school is damaging to students learning and their social developed, students are better in schools because of the teachers they have for role models. Having someone to remind you of staying on task, getting your work done is very helpful. Nobody is perfect there are distractions everywhere, but having encouraging adults around is amazing. Social skills are very important for having a job and being able to fully communicate with people. High school really help students finding their life paths.";0
"The author supports the idea of exploring venus, because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth. However, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challengin are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such a enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because off the insight to eb gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.";0
"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."", the author discusses the idea of using Facial Action Coding Systems in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System is a software that allows computers to read expressions of faces. For example, this program was able to detect that the Mona Lisa was, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" ( D'Alto 1-2) This technology could have a great impact on children in school. Putting computers with Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing to them, is a good idea.

The Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in classrooms. In most classrooms now, there are 20-30 students and only one teacher. This is a great responsiblity for a teacher to take on. With computers as help, learning in a classroom could be much more affective. Dr Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor."" Many children in classrooms can fall behind without one on one time with a teacher. However since classrooms are so big, it becomes less likely that a child who wants help actually gets the attention they need. With computers like these in classrooms, kids who need a little extra could get the practice without a teacher.

Although this technology could be life changing in many ways, it has its flaws. For example, we are still a long ways from being able to put these computers in every classroom. Also, the cost of this techonology is unknown. This could add to extra fees famlies have to pay when sending their child to school, some of which may not be ablee pay for this type of computer system. Even if the cost of these computers were low and they were able to be in every classroom, would they work properly all the time? Technology is not perfect and if the Facial Action Coding System is unrelable, then are they really worth the money?

Yes, these computers are worth the money. Despite all the possiblities that could go wrong with this technology, they still have great potential. Children would be getting a better education. Some students are ahead of others, and need more of a challenge. The Facial Action Coding System can help those who seem bored in class, which gives the children the oppertunity to learn more in a regular classroom setting. It also makes everyone in the classroom equal. While everyone is on the computer, it doesn't seperate those who need help from those who do. This will boost children's confidence and teach them to like school more while getting a better education at the same time.

There are several benefits to putting the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing. This system can help provide more challenging material and a oppertunity to learn more for the students who need it. It can also provide more help and extra lessons for the students who are behind in class. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would help out teachers who have big classes. It would provide more one on one time for all students which would boost the rate they learn at, proving it is a good idea to have these types of computer systems in a classroom. ";0
"Should people who are driving be able to use cell phones while they drive? I strongly disagree, as there are new teens driving everyday. Teens tend to use their phones a lot and they probably haven't been driving as much as some adults. Regardless of how long you have been driving i personally think you should not be texting and driving, or doing anything with your phone. Teens are probably the people who cause most of the crashes due to them texting and driving or not focusing on the road.

Most teens take driving as if they were in a video game. I believe they use this thought process because in some video games you tend to do reckless driving and i think some teens take that idea. I personally think that ever since smart phones came out the car crash rates have gone up extremely. This is due to the egear of wanting to use your cellular device. I don't think we can stop texting and driving because most people do it and then act innocent when they see a police car near them. I know this from experience.

I disagree with this because people's lives are in danger with just a swipe or just writing a 3 letter text. You keep your eyes off the road which means anything can happen in the slightest second. I think there should be some type of app that you have to use in order to turn your car on, which then locks your phone until the car is off or you have reached your destination. Texting and driving is a serious cause and teens & adults should take this more seriously so they can risk not getting into an accident.      ";0
"The use of the new technology that can read emotional expressions would be good in classrooms because if you are doing work on the computer yit can scan your face too see if you are bored or happy. For the first example it woild improve the way students worked or if they are having a bad day it could scan there face and show like happy/positive things on the screen. Antother example is it will improve everyones attitude and some people could change.

For the first example If classrooms had this technology kids might start doing their work and they wont feel bored because if the computer read there expression they could make the work they have on the computer fun by making it into a game or like showing postive quotes or just outgoing stuff in general. From my experince work does get boring on the computer if you are there for a long period of time so this technology could help improve how kids work.

Another example would be how any persons attitude could always change if they are just in a happier mood. If any student is having a bad day and they are working on the computer this technology could scan this persons face and make them happier by putting good stuff on the screen. It could also cange how they act so for example in paragraph 6 it says ""if a student is confused or bored it cold modify the lesson and make it fun so they arnt confused or bored"".

Those are some reasons why this technology could help out in classrooms it could improve the way students learn and help them if they are sad, in a bad mood, or anything else. ";0
"1.) What is the Electoral College' A electoral college is a process, not a place. I didn't know they had 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes. Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . . The Congressional delegation one of each memeber in the house. But i do think the District of Columbia. is each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Chosen a party political party, responsibilities. but what will happen if something happens to the congress what will go wrong? for the stuff that they be having partys for the policital paartys & stuff what do they do that for the things they have. like will the president be alright with this stuff that be going on but these things is good cause we will like the same things but idk know it that was alot of 538 electors but some of it will work.

2.) THe Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' I understand what the American people is doing its a factor that some of yall got to learn thoe. Kennedy i don't understand his and they way he do like its alot for the candidate but for the other ones i dont know like what's up with the candidate and kenndey, the passage says .. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please... oh, and what if the state sends two slates of electors to Congress? it happened in Hawaii in 1960. Vice President richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent."" what if that happend again? During the 200 campaign , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . . Yes that's right they do have to make it to the candidate first they just can't walk up there first you got to be president by the pesident frist if you not by him or here then you messe dup for goood its not working out like that at all. it's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it all mostly assertions in without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

3.) In 2012 election, for example, Obamma received 61.4 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney. . . . BEcause almkost all states award electoral votes on a winner -take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in astate creates a landslide electoral -vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . . The residents of each other regions are likely to be a successful presidents. The residents of other regions are likely to be feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard. Swing States' [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. . . . Big Staes' The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidentail candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . . Avoid Run-Off Elections' Nixon in 1968 and Clintion in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes , while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is presssure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate. . . . It can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president amy turn of potentail that is right because sometimes you really don't have that much of that stuff like that now but sometimes its hard to see stuff like that but you got to work on some things like that but not everything likec come on now. so candidates who do that some want. . . . But of course no voter's vote swings a naional election, and spite of that about one-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012's] election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . . Democrats in Texas, for example , or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect , tghey have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. . . .            ";0
"Volcanoes are one of the most fascinating natural phenomena that have been observed on Earth. They are geological formations that can be found in many parts of the world, including the Pacific Ring of Fire. Volcanic eruptions can have devastating effects on people and the environment, but they can also be an enjoyable educational activity. In this essay, we will explore what causes volcanoes to erupt, the layers of a volcano, and the effects of volcanic eruptions.

Volcanic eruptions are caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. When two tectonic plates collide, one plate is forced beneath the other, creating a subduction zone. As the plate is forced deeper into the Earth's mantle, it heats up and begins to melt, forming magma. The magma rises through the Earth's crust, forming a volcano.

The layers of a volcano are divided into three main types: the cone, the magma chamber, and the mantle. The cone is the visible part of the volcano, and it is made up of solid rock and ash. The magma chamber is the reservoir of molten rock beneath the cone, and it is where the magma rises before it is expelled during an eruption. The mantle is the layer of the Earth's mantle that is closest to the surface, and it is where the magma originates.

Volcanic eruptions can have devastating effects on people and the environment. Lava flows can destroy everything in their path, and ash and gas emissions can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. Volcanic ash can also affect the climate, as it reflects sunlight back into space, cooling the Earth's surface.

Despite the destructive nature of volcanic eruptions, they can also be an enjoyable educational activity. Volcanoes are a natural wonder, and they can teach us a lot about the Earth's geology and the processes that shape our planet. Visiting a volcano can be a thrilling and educational experience, and it can help students to develop a greater appreciation for the natural world.

In conclusion, volcanoes are fascinating geological formations that are caused by the movement of tect";1
"Students today are under unprecedented pressure both academically and extracurricularly. On top of having to juggle their studies and succeed in their exams, many of them are required to participate in extracurricular activities in order to appear more desirable to future colleges or employers. This only adds to the mountain of stress they already experience as they progress through their academic journey. 

Furthermore, making the demands of participating in these activities would not only take away from students’ much-needed rest and relaxation, but can also mean that they are unable to finish their school assignments or study in a timely manner. At the same time, many of these students may need to work part-time to cover their living expenses, which can further pile on the stress and consume their precious free time. 

With all these factors in mind, it should be left up to the students and their families as to whether or not they should participate in extracurricular activities. It is only fair, and in many cases much more beneficial, to grant the students and their families the freedom to make their own decisions. After all, this generation of students has to be prepared to enter the world after graduation, and they should not be expected to do this with an immense amount of stress bearing down on their shoulders. Therefore, it is vital that students and their families should be given the freedom to make their own decisions when it comes to extracurricular activities.";1
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes away from home by way of online or video conferencing. I do not think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I feel this way for multiple reasons. Students would get easily distracted by things at home, they wouldn't be getting the full school experience by staying at home, and there would be different ways to learn in a school, which would help them be the best student they can be.

Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would get easily distracted by things. It is far easier to get distracted at home than it is at school. For example, at home, there is so many things a student to do. They could watch television, play video games, eat freely, or use their phone. The problem is no one can keep the student focused but themselves because there is no teacher with them. So if a student gets distracted, they can't work to the best of their ability and it will be difficult to get them back on task. Whereas in school, if a student is distracted, a teacher can get them back to work and focused.

Students also would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would not get the full school experience by staying at home. School is not just for education. The social aspect of school is huge shaping out how students will be in the future. For example, students meet new people at school, whether it be in a class, through athletic teams, clubs, etc. If you are taking classes at home, you lose the chance to meet new people or participate in school sports and clubs. I know for a fact that if I took online classes from home I would miss out on the experience of school and I would regret it later on in life.

Another reason students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home would be that in a school, there is more ways for a teacher to teach, and for a student to learn, helping them become the best student they can be. There is many ways for a student to learn. For example, teachers can make up games as a way for the student to have fun while learning. Another way would be to do activities with a partner or in a group, learning how to work with other people to get the task at hand done. If students are learning at home, none of that is possible. The teachers would either just be telling the students what to write down, or the student would just get notes to copy. Either way, the student would not enjoy that.

Some people might say that offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home would be beneficial, but I do not feel that way. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home for various reasons. Students would get easily distracted by things at home, they would miss out on the full experience of attending an actual school, and in a school there is different ways to learn, helping the students be the best they can be. ";0
"Can you Deal with taking a life and living in regret for the rest of your life?

Well think about this is driving and texting really needed....is that message you sending so important that you could spend the rest of your life behind bars?

Texting and driving is illegal in almost every state you can think of because of so many incidents were some has been hurt or critically injured because your hand was on your phone and not on the wheel. Texting is a everyday thing for us we have to tweet and reply to comments but at what cost. If you sitting down on the couch and texting that's fine or even riding with someone who driving as long as you are in the passenger seat and not distracting them so they can keep they eyes on the rode.

Do you think that your life is important to live? Let's take a break and think about it .....if you are crossing the street with your daughter or family member maybe even just you and you happen to see a car that is just speeding but they pick up they phone because they got a message in a hot second your life is taken away or put in danger because of that driver your family would hate them and be heart broken over your loss. Now think about this if the roles were reverse and you were behind that wheel and there a kid crossing the street just enjoying there life happy go lucky and because your boyfriend or mommy send you a message like i miss you , where are you , come pick me up or something in that nature and you decide to respond to it then BOOM you hit that kid. For the rest of your life you will have to deal with that pain and constant flash backs.

I personally don't believe that people should be able to use there phone while operating a motor vehicle . The average percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were they were distracted by their cell phones is 21% . Even though that's not a high percent it's alot of hurt for the parents victim and the driver of that vehicle cause not only are you putting your sure in danger you putting that victim at risk of loosing there life to. The average percent of kid's and adults admitting they still text and drive is 35% that mean over 35% of kids around the world is texting and driving everyday putting their life and our life in jeopardy to.

In Conclusion tell me do you think texting and driving should be legal or illegal ...make sure you think about it hard cause next time it could be you or someone you know. Always check the facts and let someone know they could end their life by just one stupid mistake . You have the choice to do right after reading this essay to live your life to the fullest of have it cut short by a car hitting you or you hitting someone or being sentenced to life or even worse death . Please save a life by spreading this message because everyday we here of a hit and run stop texting and save a life.    ";0
"Emotions are sometimes difficult to read. If there is technology that can make reading emotions easier, why be agaisnt it? Using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

The use of this technology can change the preception of schooling. In the artice, Dr. Huang predicts that the classroom computer will be able to modify the lesson when it recognizes a student is becoming confused or bored. This will help students who struggle to understand some class material. The computer can, based on the students emotion, change the way the material is seen, heard, and understood. If a computer can read the emotions of someone who is trying to study, it can alter the way the person studies to make it easier and more enjoyable. This can help graduation rates rise and dropout rates lower.

Some may argue that using this technology isn't fair to the students. That students emotions shouldn't be read by a computer. That to understandable. However, some students are afraid to ask for help because they don't want to be precieved as dumb or unintelligent. With this system, the students emotions will be confidentually read and then used to help the student. Because it can help struggling students, students who have difficults studying, and students who are afraid to voice their confusion, using the Facial Actions Coding System is a valuable tool in classroom..";0
"I think that we should change the electoral collage because is it not very organize and theirs slot of voters that dont like it also in the electoral college you just dont vote for the president that you want for your nation you sre also for slays that you might not even want or like it should just be that you vote for the president that you want to represent your nation.

The electoral college has a major arguemnt against it electoral college. is what we might call the disaster. factor the american people should consider them selves lucky that the 200 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. the system also allows the legislatures and they defy that shouldnt be like that they should let the people pick . In the eleltoral college they could be a a tie and thru popularity the presendent wins faster and theirs no tie and people dont have to worry about a tie also the electoral collage is unfair to voters because of the winner takes all the system in each state thats not  fair to the voters very unfair.

The electoral college has been notice to be unfair also is outdated and irrational the best agrguemnt in favor of the electoral college are mostly assertions with out basis in reality and the arguments against direct election are spurious at best that y people dont whant the electoral collage no more it should  be abolish

The electoral collage should be taken down it is not fair at all and voters dont want the electoral college. because it is being unfair to them and i agree with them .

Also in the electoral collage theirs been many mistakes. like when vice president richard nixon.  who was presiding over the seanate validated only his opponents elelcectors thats not right or fair he made sure to do so with out establishing a precedent what if it happens again the nations doseant need that .

Voters in the electoral college they get confuse and they canot control for whom their voting for and sometimes they get confused that they vote for the wrong candidate the electoral college is not organize and is no good.                                                                                                                   ";0
"School is a place where you learn about many topics. Having an extracurricular activity after school is very important. They can benefit you in many ways. There are many types of extra activities. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Extracurricular activities are very important, because they give you a chance to learn about a broader variety of topics. In high school, most activities will give you one credit towards your degree. This is important because your degree is what decides weather or not you can get a good job. After school classes can also be fun. If one is doing an interesting activity after school, that could be fun and it can be something one can look forward too. Depending on the school, there will be a wide variety of extra things to do after your day is over. With that being said, there must be something that is fun or interesting.

Most students will blow off after school activities because they know that they don't need to engage in them. If students must participate, than they would not be able to ignore them. Now even though this would not be every day, it would still be very beneficial to do extracurricular activities. Some students do multiple after school classes a week, but this can be stressful at times. That is why one activity is enough to start. Most children that participate in these are more successful in school. Extra classes is also a way to make new friends. Every principle should have every student do an extra activity after or during school.

This is why I think that every student should engage in an extra activity after school. Having an extracurricular activity after school is very important. They can benefit you in many ways. There are many types of extra activities. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.      ";0
"Believe it or not cars are getting old. Its not like Miami or Newyork that you see a car driving everywhen to differrent ways. In some of these cities they feel comfortable without using cars. most of the cities are baned due to the polution the air has,in the other hard countries are using other kinds of transportation to get around. Now just using ur car and driving just can lieve you without money in ur pocket.

Let me just explain the advantages of limites car usage. People around are just comfortable. They are living their lives without using their cars and they are happy. Like in Germany, vauban they are completely ""

car free

"" in the passage it explains that there are only two places people at vauban can park in a large garage where the car owner buys the space fo $40,000. Thats just exxagerative, as a result only 70 percent of vauban's families don't own cars. Heidrun walter says ""

When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way

"". Life just goes on without cars.

There is no doubt paris that has the most cars are actually not allowing people to drive their cars. like it said in the report Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear off the global city, therefore if they use their car during they are banned they have pay the fine of 22-euro (

$31

).It is better to lieve ur cars at home than get a fine,i tell you that. Since the air is poluted, therefore using cars brings more polution. Just banning cars forever should bet for the best.

Now adays people are using other transportation to get around without using cars. In the country bogota they banned the cars to only have buses and taxis for the people to get around. Bogota have a goal to promote alternative transportation. They want the people to participate in giving money to their country. The mayor of Bogota Antansas Mockus excitedly says ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating"". It is great that people don't have to depend on cars anymore. they have another way to get around, especially the healthy way like riding a bike, or skating.

Who wants to ride a car anymore. Its just too expensice. lieves people broke, without even a penny in their pocket. People have other things to pay like their bills. Cars are just a distraction. Gas prices are just shooting up like a rocket,in the other hand still have to pay the car's insurance, and all that. People can afford a car anymore.

In conclusion, not people are living their lives without cars. Cars are banned due to the polution in the air. Other people are having another way to get around with out using cars, and its just less expensive. People don't have to worry about cars anymore.                            ";0
"Being able to tell exactly how somebody else is feeling would be very valuable in a classroom. Able to tell when one of your classmates is sad, angry, or happy. You can change the subject of whatever your class is talking about to make someones mood change. You can tell if someone is being truthful about their emotions.

Not everyone will just go up to you and start talking about how bad their day is or how happy they are because they could be very shy or don't like to express their emotions. If you're able to tell if someone is sad or scared you can then think of the best way to make them feel better or make them feel comfortable and safe.

When a teacher can tell if one of his or her students are feeling down they can say something funny or have a fun activity for the class to do, just to get the student distracted with whatever their going through just for a while. Teachers sometimes even will pull you to the side and ask you what is going on and just being able to let everything out can even make you feel better.

How do i know i can trust someone? This article has explained how a rela genuine smile can be distinguished from a fake and untruthful smile. I would really like to be able to tell how or when when someone has good or bad intentions with being my friend.

If you can tell if someone isn't feeling okay or is down you try your best figuring ou thwta you can do to help them out. Put a smile on somebody's face.";0
"As the world develops and time goes forward, technology is advancing by the year. From cell phones to gaming devices, every piece of technology is getting better and better. One piece of technology is also getting better as years go on, and that is space techonolgy and transportation. NASA has created an idea to be able to live close to the hosstile conditions of Venus; in which, people would live on blimp-like vehicle over the planet itself. Venus's climate and terrain might be an issue to the growing pursuit that people and companies (like NASA) are making towards travilling to Venus. That's not to say that the study and travel towards the planet can have pros and cons.

The weather on Venus is more perilous than anything we could think about on Earth. In paragraph 3 of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" With the facts of how dangerous it is on Venus, it is insane to think of anyone who would want to travel to and study the planet of Venus.

On the other hand, NASA and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" think the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit. In paragraph 4 of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.."" While the conditions of our neighboring planet, Venus, seem to outweigh the history of the symetry that our planets once were; exploration and the study of Venus might be a worthwhile cause.

Even without the traveling to Venus, companies and astrologist can still learn a great deal about the atmosphere of Venus without putting their lives at risk. In the concluding paragraph of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus,"" the author breifly talks about how studying the planet of Venus can benefit the intellingence of our world. The author states in paragraph 8, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author's opinion in the article could possibly be spot-on. With the challenges of trying to gain access to Venus's surface, the United States, as well as several other countries, have expanded their technological advances.

With everything being said and done, exploration and the studying of Venus has major pros and cons. The pros being that with the challenge of Venus's surface, technology has advance to the point where one day, humans may be able to travel to the hostile planet. the cons of course being the temperature, pressure, terrain, and atmospher of the planet we are so desperately trying to travel to. Travel should not just be expanded to neighboring planets; with the topic of space travel being more popular than ever, human can start the new era of space travel.";0
"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the narrator tells us why NASA is struggling so much to explore the planet of Venus, what's so hard about it, and what their plan is.

The author believes that studying Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author supports his idea very well by proving many good points and using factual evidence.

The author supports his idea by proving good points and using evidence. You can tell he is sincere about this and would like for the scientists to try and further explore Venus and its commodoties. For example, in paragraph 8, he talks about how our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts. This is a very reasonable statement, and proves that he actually has a reason to want Venus to be explored. Also in paragraph 8, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This quote supports the authors idea because he is giving an ethical reason about why he wants scientists to create the technology to be able to put humans on Venus. He is explaining to the readers why he wants this to take place, and by giving his opinion, it automatically supports him and his idea.

The author does many things to help support his idea throughout this article. He is very opinionated about why he wants there to be people on Venus. The author support his idea very well by proving many good points and using factual evidence.";0
"Everyday I wake up and catch the bus at 6:50 in the morning, and I don't get home until 5:45 at night. That's nearly twelve hours of being on the bus and being at school when I could be doing something more productive like cleaning my room, sleeping, or studying for a test. As much as I don't like school, taking it online would hardly be helpful. Some people may say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. Clearly, they are wrong because it would be easy to cheat and students would face isolation.

With online school, it would be extremely easy to cheat. Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment. Some people are going to say that happens regardless of whether or not it's in person or online. They are wrong because it's much easier to cheat online with a very low chance of getting caught.

One thing a person could face while attending online school is isolation. In prison, solitary confinement is a punishment, so why make it an everyday thing as a free person? The best part about school for most, if not all, of us is our friends. For those with best friends, going a long time without them is a task. You don't have your laughing buddy and you miss them, even if you have other friends you couldnt be with. Most people feel sad when they don't have a friend to be with them in class and share the same struggles with when you fail or do bad. School is at least seventy-seven percent better when you have friends to go at it with. When you're in your room all day learning, that's no fun. School is required by the government and is already sad enough as it is. The only thing that personally keeps me going is my friends. Without them, I would have no will to do my work as they are the ones constantly telling me to do this and do that and don't procrastinate. Those friendly reminders are honestly what keep me from failing my classes. I couldn't name all the times I forgot to do an assignment and my friends were like, ""did you do so and so?"" And I would say, ""oh wow I completely forgot about that, thanks for reminding me,"" and would get started at lunch or in the morning. So if school were to be offered online, those reminders would fall through the cracks and I would have missing assignments left and right. People may say that school online doesn't affect friendships. On the contrary, they are extremely wrong because you wouldn't be able to see them everyday as you normally do during the school day.

Some people say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. However, they are incorrect because it would be easy to cheat and students would face isolation from their friends. Cheating would be readily available as you don't have the teachers eyes on you which makes it easier to cheat, no matter how honest a teenager says they are because we are impulsive beings who rarely think logically. Isolation would be a terrible added factor of online school as friends keep most of us going during the school day.";0
"Chris Gardner is an inspiring individual who has achieved success through hard work, dedication, and perseverance. His journey of staying on top of his studies and overcoming obstacles in his life has enabled him to make a significant impact on society.

Gardner's story began in 1961 when he was born into poverty in Philadelphia. He struggled to make ends meet, and his family often had to rely on government assistance. Despite these challenges, Gardner was determined to succeed in school and pursue his dream of becoming a stockbroker.

Gardner's hard work paid off when he was accepted into the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. However, he soon faced another obstacle when he was unable to afford the cost of tuition. To make ends meet, Gardner took on multiple jobs, including working as a security guard and a janitor.

Despite these challenges, Gardner remained committed to his studies and spent every spare moment he had studying for his exams. He also sought out mentorship from successful business leaders, who offered him guidance and advice.

Gardner's hard work and dedication paid off when he landed an internship at a prestigious brokerage firm. During his internship, Gardner demonstrated his knowledge and skills, and was eventually offered a full-time job.

However, Gardner's success was not without its challenges. In 1987, he was wrongfully accused of insider trading and was forced to leave his job and his apartment. Gardner was forced to live in homeless shelters and public transit stations, but he refused to give up.

Instead, Gardner used this time to reflect on his life and his goals. He realized that he had been taking his success for granted and that he needed to focus on the things that truly mattered. Gardner began to read books, take classes, and practice meditation, all of which helped him to stay focused and motivated.

Gardner's perseverance paid off when he was eventually cleared of the charges and was able to return to his job as a stockbroker. He continued to work hard and eventually became a successful businessman in his own right.

Gardner's story is a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. His";1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Have you ever not studied so you could prepare for a big game?

Statistics say, 1/3 kids decide to practice their sport instead of study for a big test. That is why I think you should have a B average to be able to be on a team. When you have a B average that means you can manage studying and being on a team at the same time. Sometimes when you focus on something other than school it can distract you from what is really important. Also, if you set the average to B that is setting a goal for the students; to have good grades so they can play on whatever team they would like.

Many students at our school play on a team; almost half of our students average at a C or below. If every student had to average a B to play on a team, you would see almost half of the students grades go up. Just so they could play on their team. That would mean half of the students grades would be raising.

Raising the average would help about every student focus more on school. You would see improvement in a lot of students. When they focus, they do better, when they do better they are improving , and when they improve they can play on teams. Which is making the students able to manage school and teams.

This would make the entire school improve. Over half of the schoool would raise their grade point average because, they are trying harder so they can play on the team. The teams would also grow stronger because, the students would start learning how to manage their time. For example, from 3-4:30 i will study for my test and 4:30-6 i will practice soccer. This one choice will change our entire school.

Our school will grow stronger and better by getting each to have the average B to play on a team. better teams, smarter students, higher grade point averages, and a better school over all. please, put my opinion in mind.      ";0
"The idea of using facial recognition technology to identify how someone is feeling is a new one. It is also a preposturous one. You cannot fully understand what someone is feeling by looking at their face, and attempting to do so is an invasion of their privacy. Facial action coding systems should not be used in classrooms.

The idea that you could fully decipher what someone is feeling based on how they look is absurd. You cannot decide for yourself how someone feels based on the movement of their muscles. For example, if someone looks sad, you cannot just decide that they are sad, just because they look that way. If a machine decides I look confused, does it really have the right to change what I am learning? To understand how someone is really feeling, you have to first ask yourself why they might be feeling that way. Once you understand this, then you can determine what is happening. A machine cannot read minds. If I am confused about one thing, the machine does not know what. Not to mention that people often feel varying emotions at varying times of the day. I might be sad one minute, then laugh at a joke the next. I might not understand something, than understand it in the next second. The machine might automatically change something I understood based on a few seconds of confusion. This is not efficient or helpful.

To read someone's emotions based on their facial expressions is an invasion of their privacy. Let's assume this machine can accurately decipher someone's emotions based on muscle movement. What if you don't want people to know how you're feeling? If I am confused about something, and I am embarrased about it, suddenly the whole word knows. It should be up to the student to decide whether or not they want to seek help, not some magical machine. By forcing students to share private emotions, you run the risk of making them less willing to go to school. Who would want to go to a school where everyone knows how you feel at all times of the day? That would affect learning severely, and would definitely do more harm than good. Hindering learning in an attempt to better understand students is not worth it.

Using this software in classrooms would be ineffective, and even if it did work, it would be a huge invasion of privacy. This software should be used on paintings and nothing more. It is not accurate enough to do anything other than hold back human learning. This software is not fit for classrooms. ";0
"Dear Senator,

Presidential elections are closer than they seem, and your people have a complaint you need to hear. It involves the right to vote directly for a leader, and the ignoring of the vast majority. People have spoken in favor of omitting the Electoral College and sticking to what the people themselves deem acceptable for a president; not what one person decides for millions.

It does not make sense for the voters of America not to vote directly for who they want to lead, represent, and protect their counrty. Especially if the people cannot even choose who the electors are! That is ignoring the 23rd Amendment all together.

But do not get me wrong, I understand that some people are more comfortable with the Electoral College and they prefer to leave it in the hands of somebody politically intelligent and aware, but that usually means that those people need education and knowlege about the state of their country, and nned to be aware of how important their right to vote directly is. The Electoral College can go so wrong so fast and we need to go by what the majority millions say rather than the minorities with little to no knowlege. Us as Americans need to be educated when it comes to who is running in order for us to be able to say yes or no for ourselves- not depend on an unknown entity who might not even listen to what the people are saying.

So many great people who were voted most popular and accepted amongst the people have actually lost presidency over the fact that the College had the upper hand. This is unfair to those in America who took the time to directly vote and who took the time to learn and watch debates that the opponent won due to the fact that thousands upon thousands did not speak for themselves and left it to somebody else blindly.

In conclusion, Senator, I am asking you to think: is there ever really a happy turn out from ignoring the vast majority or doesn't that lead to an eventual uprising? Letting one speak for all is an unitelligent thought, we are a country where the people have power, have a voice, and are aware. Losing that is losing what makes us free. We all need the vote, we all need the voice, and we all have the right to choose exactly what we want for the future of this country.

Thank you for your time, and thank you for listening.

With Upmost Respect,

I belive that the technology can be some what invaled because you cant excatly tell how a person thinks or feels because they could be sad on the inside but show a nuteral face on the outside or, they could be crying but while crying but crying tears of joy .How could a computer tell you the way that someone feels if they could feel a totaly diffrent way. A way a person looks on the outside may not be the way that they are feeling on the inside a computer is not a person it doesnt have emotions so how excatly could it telll what the emotions of another person or how they are feeling at the time . I dont belive that many people can tell the diffrence of a fake smile or a real smile so let alone how can a computer tell the diffrence between a fake or real smile because people think im happy alot. I usally fake my smile because i am sad on the inside but i look happy on the outside. With me saying that just by looking at a person can be deciving because you never know how the person excatly feels or what is going on in there head so therefore i belive that the facs can not tell a persons emotions.;0
"Mustangs, Mercedes, Hummers , and the ""Punch buggy "" are just a few brands of vehicles well known in America . Vechicles today are big factor in life  for the reason that cars are used every single day all around the world as transportation and although we have the bus or other ways to get to places , driving is the most selected choice to get to a location. With that being said , vehicles being used everyday has it positives and negatives .  Positives could be how it takes you to a location quicker than riding a bike or taking a walk ,  but have you ever thought all the negatives there is  when a car being used has ?Could you only imagine a world without car? It may seem like a crazy idea to think a world without cars but a life without cars could be a well functional world for the reason that cars could have contribuation to polution in our air or could make the world a so called different place.

In Addition, driving could have a contribution to pollution . Many may not think about it but cars emissions pollute the air we breath. In a article called ""Paris bans driving due to smogs"" it states how "" after days of near record pollution in the air ,Paris enforced partial driving to clear their polution. Also how cold nights and warm days caused a warmer layer of air that trapped cars emission when used in Paris."" Pollution in our air may seem a bit scary but the movement of less driving has already began without us noticing .In another article named "" The End of Car Culture"" it speaks on the subject "" there has been a decrease in America in buying cars and driving.""  Which is a great start to a better future in our world.

Furthermore , We can make the world a so called differnet place for the better. In a article called ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" it states how ""their world with any cars has been sucessful by making where they live more compact and accessible to public transportation. This new approach now stores can be placed a walkway from main street than malls along a distant hallways ."" Many places around the world have made a step to a better world for example in a article named "" Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" it states "" they had a day free of cars aka driving free to reduced thier pollution and have a more clean better world . Results from this event turned out sucessful , for that other countries have joined this event.""

In Conclusion , A world without cars may seem crazy however just think of all the damages it does to the world than the positives because pollution is not something easy to get rid of and by stepping up to make change as it already began will help us live in  a better clean world.    ";0
"From playing an instrument to battling in a game, from sports to journalistic and fantastical writing, there are so many options of extracurricular activities. These clubs and teams can improve both the mental and physical health of students, affecting their daily lives positively and giving them another group of friends. A new rule that students must participate in at least one activity is an incredible opportunity to grow.

Having a place to relax and have fun in school can often be a struggle for students. While doing an extracurricular activity, students can release stress and have fun doing something they love. In a club or team, students form a sort of ""family."" They all share a passion or interest in the subject and get to know people they would not otherwise have met. Throughout the school day, students can build up confusion, worry or anger about projects and friendships. This gives them an opportunity to have fun doing something they enjoy.

While these activities can simply be enjoyable, it also can improve health and affect students' day to day lives. Sports can keep students physically active and engaged. It has been scientifically proven that physical activity can improve a person's happiness and reduce stress, although this also applies to any activity that is enjoyed by the student. While participating in a club, students can ignore other thoughts and focus only on what is at hand. This is exactly what students tend to need after a long day of school.

With an outlet for energy and anxiety, students can focus better on their schoolwork and can also get the help they may need from their friends.

Many people worry about participating in these activities, believing that students will not have enough time to focus on their studies. However, many of the students that already to extracurricular activities are active in multiple clubs. These students still manage to get their work done. Also, as this rule of participation would be school wide, teachers would likely lighten how much homework they give out. Finally, this prepares students for the future. They will have to learn to lead balanced lives as adults, so this will give them the opportunity to learn how to work efficiently and still have downtime.

All together, having an activity outside of school is a good idea for students as it improves health and grades and gives opportunities to have new friends. Enforcing this policy would be an interesting change and would lead to a happier and more efficient school environment. ";0
"Is good idea for students to recive online courses. In my point of veiw, it will be better for students to attend to regulars classes at schools. In this way students will be able to socialize with other people. Also, they will have the opportunity to do other activities. In this days sudents recive free education and it is easy for them to attend to school. Online programs may have a cost for the courses or classes.

if students attend to schools they will learnd more about their classes because teachers will be able to teach them with enthusiasm. In the other hand, is good idea to recive classes online but you will not have the opportunity to interac with teachers or other students. If you go to school there will be a way that you can make new friends that you can share adventures and stories with them. It will be more benefit for students who go to school than students who stay at home watching their scream on the computer.

Attening school also give you the option to enroll many activies. For example, you can join the football team. music band, and the theater shows. I know a friend that he didn't like to attend school, but when he start to play for the football team at his local school, he was more exiting to speen time at school. At school you can do many actiivities. In contrast, reciving classes online can be a good option for does students that don't have the resources to go to school. For example, if they don't have a bus stop or the school is to far away. Also, for the students with special disability.

The united states have the advantage to have free education. This is a good thing for does parents with not reasourses. Parents can send students to school without worry for a monthly payment. They know that their children are in a good learning place. In the other hand, having classes online may cost a amount of your money. It will be difficult for students because they will have to find a job to soport their online paymants for the courses. In this way have classes online is not a better option for all.

Offering distance learning as an opion for students is not a good advantage for all the people who want to study. it's because many students prefer to attend to school than staying at home.

It's a good thing interac with your teachers or other students at shool.           ";0
"Hey there!  For this assignment, I researched programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four, and I'm here to share my findings. 

First off, let's talk about the advantages of graduating early.  According to some studies, students who graduate early have a higher chance of getting into college, as they can enter their freshman year earlier than their peers.  Plus, they can start their careers sooner, which means they can start earning money and gaining work experience faster. 

But,  moving to a new place can be tough.  It can be hard to make new friends and adjust to a new environment.  And,  let's not forget about the financial implications.  Graduating early means paying bills and rent earlier, which can be a real challenge for some students. 

Now,  let's analyze the financial side of things.  Graduating early can save students money on tuition and living expenses, but they might have to pay more for things like rent and utilities.  It's like,  you're saving money in one area, but spending more in another. 

But,  there are some programs that can help students graduate early without breaking the bank.  Like,  some schools offer free or low-cost housing for students who graduate early.  And,  some organizations provide financial support to students who want to graduate early. 

So,  my conclusion is that it can be a good idea for some school districts to offer programs that allow students to graduate early.  But,  it's important to consider the potential challenges and make sure the program is sustainable and beneficial for all students. 

In conclusion";1
"Dear Local Government,

I am writing to express my strong objections to the proposal of changing the school system from a five-day to a four-day workweek. It is my belief that this will prove to be damaging in a multitude of ways. 

Firstly, the lack of an extra day will drastically cut down the amount of time in the day for students to do their work, test their skills during extracurricular activities, and participate in other academic engagements, making it nearly impossible for them to establish a balance between leisurely activities and extracurricular activities. Furthermore, the truncated amount of time available for learning and growth will reduce the quality of education that the students witness in their respective disciplines.

A four-day school week will also cause undue stress and pressure on students, as all their lessons will be crammed into four days rather than five, making it hard for them to take a break from the workload. Additionally, with the three-day weekend, students may become lethargic and unenthusiastic in learning and developing skills, and gradually become less productive. 

This year’s final exams have shown us how the five-day school week motivates students to become more prepared for the assessments and can help them be ready for the future. Without this extra day, it is likely that student achievement will go down. 

For all these reasons, I urge you not to adopt a four-day work week and to maintain the five-day school week for better academic achievements and continuity. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]";1
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining the similarities between the Earth and how we can overcome our differences as well.

The author believes it is worthy of a shot because of the ways to avoid major problems, such as flying at a high altitude to evade the extreme pressure of the atmosphere and dangerous sulfuric acid clouds. The text states, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This piece of evidence shows how clever the author is willing to get to investigate Venus and just how possible this may actually be. The text also states, ""...not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equallty intimidating endeavors."" This evidence goes to show that not he is not interested in exploring the planet to purely learn about the planet itself, but it is also human curiosity that pushes us as a race to adventure and discorver things that are of the unknown.

In conclusion the author strongly supports the idea of pursuiting the exploration of Venus despite the dangers it presents. Although as the author stated, it is better to think of these ""dangers"" as challenges, as we can overcome them and reach our goal. We have the potential and technology to get there, we just need to put our heads together and do it.";0
"Sure, here is an essay in response to the prompt as if written by an average 8th grade student:

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" As an 8th grader, I completely agree with this statement. Being yourself is the most important thing you can do in life. It's easy to get caught up in trying to fit in with the crowd or impress others, but in the end, it's your individuality that makes you unique and special.

One reason why being yourself offers confidence and comfort is because it allows you to be true to who you are. When you're not trying to be someone you're not, you can focus on your own strengths and weaknesses. For example, if you're good at drawing, you can use that talent to create art and express yourself. When you're being yourself, you don't have to worry about trying to be perfect or compare yourself to others. You can just be yourself and be proud of who you are.

Another reason why being yourself is important is that it helps you develop and share your ideas. When you're not trying to be like everyone else, you can think outside the box and come up with your own unique ideas. For instance, if you're interested in science, you can explore new ways of understanding the world and share your discoveries with others. Being yourself gives you the freedom to be creative and innovative, which can lead to amazing things.

Being yourself also helps you gain experiences and become a better person. When you're not trying to be like everyone else, you can try new things and learn from your mistakes. For example, if you're interested in playing a musical instrument, you can start taking lessons and learn how to play. Even if you're not the best at it, you'll still be able to enjoy the process of learning and improving. By being yourself, you can gain new experiences and develop new skills, which can make you a more well-rounded person.

Finally, being yourself is important because it allows you to be true to who you are. When you're not trying to be someone else, you can be proud of who you are and what you stand for. You don";1
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student!  So, for this essay, I gotta decide if curfews are good or bad for teens. 

Um, so, I think curfews are kinda like, you know, they keep us out of trouble, but also, they can be unfair.  Like, on one hand, curfews can keep us safe from, you know, bad things that could happen after dark.  But on the other hand, they take away our freedom. 

Okay, so, let's talk about the laws that govern young people's behavior in public.  There are these things called curfews, which are like, rules that say we gotta be home by a certain time.  And, like, some cities have laws that say we can't even be out after dark. 

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But, like, curfews keep us safe!""  And yeah, they do.  Like, if we're out after dark, we could get into trouble with, you know, criminals or something.  But, like, sometimes I think curfews are unfair. 

For example, what if we're just, like, hanging out with our friends, and we don't wanna be home yet?  It's not fair to have to be home by a certain time just because we're teenagers.  We should be able to have some freedom, you know? 

And, like, what if we're out after dark and something bad happens?  We could get blamed for it, even if it's not our fault.  That's not cool. 

But, like, sometimes I think curfews can be good too.  They can keep us safe from, you know, bad people who might try to hurt us. *protect";1
"Limiting car usages is a goood thing because near record pollution is found in our air when cars are being used. Also 60 percent of conjestion went down in the capital of france because of cars.

Rush-hour restrictions will drop dramatically; and upscale shopping and new restuarants will be builted or will start to a variety of new customers and a jump start in better bussiness.

Recent studies have shown americans that buy fewer cars,driving less are getting less licenses as the year goes by which equals up to less pollution in the our air.

"A Big Dilemma with a Big Resolution

In fifth grade, I had to make a big decision. I had to choose between either choir or art as my sixth grade elective. The dilemma haunted me; it kept me up at night. I truly had no idea which I was going to select. Art seemed very exciting, but I had a passion for music. I decided to ask three different people for advice. First I asked my best friend. She wanted me to join them while she made paper-mache animals and drew flowers during art class. The second person I asked was my friend who was taking choir in sixth grade while I was in fifth. She told me that I should join choir because she loved the class, and she wanted me to love it too. The final person I talked to was my mom. She knew me the best out of the three people, so I figured that she would know what was best for me. All of their advice was great, and I considered all of their arguments. From this experience, I have learned that seeking multiple opinions is the best thing to do when you need advice.

Receiving advice from more than one person is important because no two people have the same life experiences. Although my fifth grade friend thought she knew what was best for me, she had never actually experienced being in a choir and did not know anything about what the class had to offer. On the other hand, my sixth grade friend knew all about choir, and she knew what being in a choir was truly like. When seeking advice, it is important to understand that some people may be able to lead you to a better decision based on their personal experiences, while others might be less helpful.

Because everyone has a unique background, seeking multiple opinions can open your eyes to ideas you had never even thought of before. When making the decision about my middle school elective, I was only considering what the class was about. Until my mom had asked me about teachers, I had never stopped to think about how the class could be more or less enjoyable based on the teacher that taught it. My mother had given me a new perspective on my dilemma. Had I only talked to my best friend or my sixth grade friend, I would've never stopped to think about the teachers and their individual personalities. Getting advice from multiple people can often times give you a new outlook on your situation.

Lastly, I believe that some people are genuinely more helpful than others in specific situations. Even though my good friends in fifth and sixth grade knew me well, my mother was the only person who truly knew what I wanted for myself. She was the only one out of the three opinions who had seen my talents for eleven years of my life, and she knew what elective was ultimately best for me. Looking back, the only reason why my fifth grade best friend wanted me to choose art was because she wanted to have me in her class. I respect her advice, but she didn't have my best interest in mind. My sixth grade choir friend was the same way as well. Although she knew me well, she was ultimately just trying to recruit people to get more members in the school choir. When reflecting on my past decision, I realize that my mother's advice was ultimately the most insightful. Seeking multiple opinions can be helpful because some people give better advice than others. Especially in situations where it is needed, good advice will only come if you ask multiple trusted people.

When you are in a situation and you need advice, asking for many diverse opinions will ultimately help you to make the better choice. To conclude the previously told story, I decided to go with the advice from my mother. I decided that I would try choir in sixth grade. As she had predicted, I loved my teacher, I always enjoyed the music, I made great friends, and I felt like I fit in perfectly. She knew what was right for me, and she helped me to make the best decision. Even though I did not choose to follow everyone's advice, I am very grateful that I chose to seek multiple opinions when dealing with my tough dilemma. It taught me that whenever I have the decision of doing so, I will always choose to seek advice from many different people, because it will ultimately lead to a more positive outcome. I learned a great lesson, and since that situation in fifth grade, I have always asked multiple people for advice when dealing with a hard decision. ";0
"Isn't it strange that cars are one of the most used transporting verhicles around? Well, of course besides busses, trains, airplanes, and all that. Almost everyone has a car, or adleast knows someone who does. Unfortunatley, in German Suburbs life goes on without cars. The Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" so the article says. They say car owner ship is allowed but there are only two places to park, large garages but that would take up to $40,000. Also, along with a home. 70% of people in the Vaubans family believe that life is better with out cars, of course they do not own cars. 57% sold a car to move here. In 2006 there was a growing trend in Europe, The United States, and else where to seperate suburban life from auto use. They call this ""Smart Planning"" Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States.

Vauban. Home to 5,500 people within a rectaugular square mile, may be the most experimented place with low-car suburban life. Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs spread-out homes and private places (such as garages, homes, etc) They were the dream towns of 1950s and still and exert a stong appeal. But some new suburbs look like the Vaubans. Not only in developed countries but also in the developing world. The United States, the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communties. Meaning the lack of usage with cars. In previous bills, 80 percent or appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent go towards other transport. On Monday, motorists were ordered to leave there cars ar home or suffer a fine of $31. Amost 4,000 drivers were fined according to reuters. 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Down 60 percent Congestion in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. Dieasel fuel was blamed. They make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Western Europe.

The days without cars started in Bogota in the mid-1990s. President Obama's goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions unvieled last week. The United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to the countrys rate in January 1995. Americans can not afford new cars and the unemployed wern't going to work anyway. The next few years will be telling.    ";0

"Have you ever needed to make a difficult decision in your life? Many people have, whether that person is a small toddler deciding if he wants vanilla or chocolate ice cream, or a teenager in high-school deciding on the college he wishes to attend. When people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help someone make a better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice suitable for you when you talk to other people with more experience and wisdom than yourself. Additionally, more people can give their own ideas and inputs into the said situation, and be able to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Thirdly, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario might tell you there might be a clear majority leaning towards one side of the choice. Asking multiple people for advice in a difficult decision can lead someone to make the choice that is best for them.

When come across a difficult decision that you may not have experienced and went through before, there is a high probability that there are other people who have been in the same place. These people will be able to offer their own experience in this decision, the decision they eventually made, and the conclusion they had arrived to. For example, a toddler choosing between ice cream could ask others what ice cream flavor they prefer, and choose the ice cream the majority of people seemed to like. Meanwhile, a teenager deciding on a college could ask adults who have recently graduated from the schools he is choosing between, and question them about their own first-hand experiences in that college. Most of the time, you will not have had enough experience to make a compatible decision yourself, while there might be other people in the world who do, and can help guide you through choosing the better one of your choices.

While trying to make a difficult decision, your point of view of the problem can be limited as you are only one person. However, after asking more people for their own ideas and inputs into the situation, you will be able to look at the decision in a more broader view, and also how it can be made in many different ways. After asking other people what they think about the decision, they will be able to give you their own ideas and thoughts that they have, and the different pros and cons that come along with it. In each difficult decision, one of the elements that make the decision so difficult is the many pros and cons that correspond to each side of the decision. The decision is then comparing which side has the better pros and the least cons. Talking to other people might enable them to see the problem in a different way that you might see it, which can add to your list containing the pros and cons of each side of the decision. Having a more complete list can let you see the problem in a different way, but also guide you into knowing that you have made the better decision after considering all the different aspects of it.

Asking many people what they would in in the same scenario of a difficult decision might also tell you if there is a clear majority leaning towards one choice, which could then tell you if there's a clear choice to be made. Making this choice would make one feel more better and confident in one's self, knowing that there are many other people who agree with making that specific choice. However, if one wishes to use this strategy, they must also make sure that they are asking people who have experience and past knowledge in the decision to be made. A high-schooler who is deciding between two colleges and wishes to ask others on the college he should attend should not ask random strangers walking down the street. Instead, he should ask other gifted students, prestigious educators, or other intelligent adults who might know how to make a better decision than the student himself. However, even after receiving plentiful advice from others, one should know that you are still the person who should take all facts into consideration, and then make the final decision based on your thoughts and ideas.

In conclusion, when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves.";0
"When I think of failing but still achieving success, two personal experiences come to mind. First, while preparing for the SATs, I studied hard for over four months but still achieved only mediocre scores. Yet rather than giving up, I studied more compromises and eventually scored high enough to gain admission into the college I wanted to attend. Secondly, my attempt to learn guitar was hampered by my lack of talent, and I kept failing every time I tried. But, I kept at it and eventually taught myself well enough to make basic melodies and chords. 

Winston Churchill’s quote “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts” has had an impact on my views on failure – it has made me realize that failure is just a stepping stone to success, and that it should not be feared, but embraced. Rather than being a deterrent to success, failure should be embraced as an opportunity to learn and grow.

I also recall one instance when a friend of mine quit soon after attempting something difficult. Even though I had tried to convince him that perseverance was the only way forward, he seemed to have given up. Seeing him give up so easily made me realize how important it is to be willing to take risks and keep failing until we eventually find success.

I believe the most successful people are the ones who maintain enthusiasm for success even after failure. They face failure, evaluate their mistakes and keep on striving for greater heights with a positive attitude and unceasing determination. People with this drive to never give up no matter how bleak the situation may be truly understand that failure is not an end, but a path to a greater success.";1
"Having students take classes from home could work out very well, but also at the same time be very defective to the student, simple as becoming less motivated to do stuff as in sports and extra after school activities, I would love to take my classes from my home being that i wouldn't have to raise my hand for things, ask to go to the bathroom, or let along ask borrow something. I also feel that students would get in less trouble if they were to take classes from home, therefore theres less of a chance of students getting into fights with others and less of a chance of students showing up late to class. Being in the comfort of your home while working on class assignments is what most students would want instead of being cramped up at school with other students.

There are mostly flaws with this idea, consequently students wouldnt always be focused on what there really suppose to be doing, I wouldnt really understand or know how it would work or how it would process therefore i couldnt say that all students would even attend the class since there is no school to go to. I think a majority of the students would be lazy and like i said less motivated to get up and do stuff because school isnt just a place where you get your education its also a place where you learn how to become a young adult and being at home everyday taking online classes would not teach any of the skills of being a young adult.

In fact taking the online classes instead of going to school could be challenging for most because some students may not have the basic requirements to get on to the online course as in a computer/device and internet overall if it came down to having to take online classes or just go to school id rather take the online classes, speaking for my self i know that i have the requirements to take online classes others may disagree.

For the parents that are involved it would probably be a hassle for them as well and what i mean by that is they would have to be the ones to register you into your online classes and plus some parents may not trust there kids home alone while there at work, I cant say that all parents would have a problem with it in fact some parents might love it because it saves them the trip of having to come down to the school when something bad happens let along helps parents that take there kids to school, therefore it helps them on their time management. Overall having a online class for students would actually be very beneficial just cause of the less inconvenience of getting to school and finishing school.";0
"Student Designed vs. Teacher Designed

Imagine you have just got assigned a summer project. You are given the topic of the assignment, but you are free to display your understanding of the material however you please, no guidelines. Would you have any idea what to do or how to even start? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue to learn during the break. What schools need to decide is that if these assignments would be more beneficial to students if they were teacher-designed or student-designed. Allowing students to design their own projects is a poor choice. Required summer assignments should be designed by a teacher because it would be the most fair choice for students, they would overall gain a better understanding of the material being taught, and they would be more likely to complete the project.

The first reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is fairness. Fairness is very important when it comes to determining the quality of a students work. Having students design their own projects makes grading everyone else's work to the same standard very difficult. For example, how does someone compare a written essay to a drawing? How would a teacher give every student fair scores based on how the individual chose to complete the assignment? When the teacher designs the project everyone is given the exact same outline. Every student is expected to answer the same number of questions and put forward the same amount of effort. Teachers being given the right to design the summer assignments would be the most fair decision for everyone involved.

Another reason why teachers should design the summer projects is that students would more likely better understand the material after completion of the assignment. If students were given the freedom to create their own project outline most of them wouldnt be able to answer many questions about the small details of the topic because they did not pay close enough attention. The material did not stick with them. Students typically worry about the ascetic of their project and completion instead of actually retaining the information. However, the purpose of a summer project is to learn new topics and be able to display a full understanding of the information. Teachers designing the summer assignments guarantees the students are exposed to the exact material they need to comprehend to obtain a good grade. The point of school is to learn and use what you have learned in the future. Students have a higher probability to remember the material from a teacher-designed project rather than one they made themselves.

The last reason teacher designed summer projects are more beneficial to students is that, when given a specific outline, the project is more likely to be completed. Answering guided questions or making a simple sideshow presentation are much easier and less time consuming for students rather than creating an entire project from scratch with no specific outline. Allowing students to create their own project could also cause huge amounts of stress. Most students when they become too stressed end up giving up or not putting in their best effort. Teachers giving them an outlined project can prevent this while also showing what the student has learned. Therefore, teacher- deigned projects are most likely to be completed and done well.

Some people believe that students should self-design their projects so they are able to express themselves creativity. Creative expression is important, but that is not the goal of a school assignment. Displaying what was learned is the goal. If students dont learn the material then what is the point of having a project? Teacher-designed projects guarantee that a student will learn something. Summer projects designed by teachers are more beneficial for students because they are fair for all students, result in a better understanding of the material, and are more likely to be completed. So teachers, next time you assign a summer project, please give your students an outline. Keep them away from over stressing and incomplete work in the grade book. Both your students lives and yours will be much simpler for it.  ";0
"Im going to be talking about driverless cars and my oppinion or position on them, I think they are a great idea, they keep people safe and notifies when they need human skill required.

Driverless cars keep you safer than if a human was driving, human error can make the difference between life and death when it comes to driving, if there is a car that doesnt need to be driven by humans, we need to fund it for safety and the advamcement of our society. Driverless cas are also safe for when they have problems that the car's computer cant handle then it notifies the driver when it does want human skill, eventually we will have cars that will need no human skill and fatal car crashes will not happen as often. If the car can drive itself and not crash nearly as often as humans do then what if everyone had one, will there be no more fatal car crashes or even crashes, will crime rates go down because the car will most likely have a sensor that is related to the owner of the vehicle so they cant get away from the police or car owner.

In a perfect world there will be no more car crashes of any sort, yes there will be the occasional fender bender, but with no more death because of fatal car crashes and saftey will rise and crime rates will go down, these are all what if's, but if these were to come true the whole world will change completly.

"Dear principal,

I just want to say if the average is got to be a B then if mostly all the jocks have C average there no one going to be playing because all the jocks are C average. But if you want to put it as B average then do it but i just want to let you know that if you do then mostly ass the good jock or whatever sport there good at they wont be playing until they bring the grade up to a B average.

Everyone likes sports but if you change the average then its not going to work out because all the good player are not going to be playing if you want the school to look bad but at the same time your trying to make it better for us but then all the slackers at the school. They will ruin it plus i don't want to go to a school that has a team at sports that are doing horrible at it i want this school to look good but at the same time look smart.

But i think it will work out either way it goes hopefully because this school great but you have too look in our shoes and be like we want win every sport but yet we have to have are grades up. So i really think its a good thing what your doing but at the same time no.

I think we should have like a vote on if we should have a rule of playing sports having a B average. What if non intelligent kids are not smart but they can play very good at sports like kids from other countries don't speak English and are not smart with English but they are good at sports but the really want to play but they don't have a good enough average.

So to be honest i don't think you should do that rule but at the same time i think its a great rule but some kids just wont out the effort in to have good grades. Like some kids out there want to actually go to collage unlike some kids don't want to even go to high school bummer.";0
"Though it may seem amazing to think about having driveless cars that can just drive us around, but what if a crash happens? Who will get blamed? The car or the driver that was supposed to be driving around. What happens if the car doesn't singal the driver that it needs help during traffic conditions or construction? This car shouldn't be developed, because it still needs technology to become a safer car. I don't approve of development of these cars, because innocent people may be blamed for an inccident that they didn't cause.

There are too many negative sides to the development of these cars on the roads and highways. Movies have influenced car companies to make this driveless car since the 2000s, which didn't have the money or technology to make then. We have all thought these cars would be the future and amazing to ride in. In these cars there are many sensors that are working all at the same time to keep the driver inside safe. What if one or two senors go are ruined by a bump in the road? Then the car would have problems with knowing what to do while driving and knowing what was surrounding the car. Still in the car, the driver still has to controll the car when it should be driverless. The driverless car needs assistance by the driver during road construction, traffic situations, and pulling in and out of driveway. All of these situations happen everyday and mostly everywhere on the road. This just means that the driver would have to still drive everywhere besides some places on the road. The driver would just get bored waiting for their turn to drive. What would happen if the car didn't notify the driver to take over the car? The effect of that situation would turn out to be a big crash or a swing and miss crash that almost would have killed the driver. As the law says,"" A safe car has the driver controlling the car at all times.""

The manufactors of these cars need to stop the development before someone gets blamed over a car's mistake. There are multiple conflicts with the development of this driveless car. What or who would be blamed if someone was injured? Sensors on the car could easily be broken and the car wouldn't be at it's best in safety for the driver. The best way to keep passengers, drivers, and pedestrians safe is to have an alert driver in control of the car. ";0
"If the principal ever decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity, I would strongly disagree with that idea. After the bell rings at the end of the day, students should have the freedom to do what they wish with their extra time. I am sure that if this happens, most students would not be happy with that, including myself. It is good to have extracurricular activities outside of school, but you cannot force it upon someone. It would be a good idea to encourage it, but not to force it. I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings, students should decide what they wish to do after school, and school is already very stressful, piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal.

If this rule was ever put into place, it would take away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings. This shouldn't even be the principal's rule anyway. If this unfair rule was ever enforced, the county or someone higher up than the principal should make this decision. Most students including myself, just want to go home and talk to their friends. I am an honor roll student, play two competitive sports, and I am also in the National Junior Honors Society, and putting even more activities on my calender would be very stressful. It is not good to just be lazy and sit around all day, but the school cannot decide what to do for you after the bell has already rung. Even if this rule was enforced nationwide, I still dont think this rule would be the slightest bit fair. Making a student stay after school and do an after school club, would actually make a good punishment for a student who has done something wrong, but forcing busy, well behaved students do that would be extremely unfair. Making a student stay after school is the whole idea of after school detention, which is used as a punishment.

Students should decide to do what they wish after school. Most days of the week I have baseball, basketball, I go to the gym, and have 30-60 minutes of homework. A lot of the time, I have two of those on the same day, sometimes even three! I am not forced to do any of those activities, I choose to do them. If the student was forced to do an extracurricular activity, that would be something their parents would decide, not the principal. All of my friends including myself strongly dislike school, but most of us are on the honor roll and do other activities, not involving the school. Besides, what benefits is the principal going to get out of forcing something upon their students? When I leave school at the end of the day and finish my homework, I want to get as far as I can get from school. Most days after school, I take a few hours of down time to relax, and a few hours of non-school related activities. I am a very productive, well balanced person, and being forced to put extra activities on top of the ones I already have, would enrage me.

School is already stressful, so piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful. Being overwhelmed with school, whether you are being bullied or you are failing your classes, can lead to depression. Many cases of teen depression have to do with school. I enjoy being productive and participating in activities, but not when it comes to school. Making students do after school activities would be a very shallow-minded thing to do, given the fact that most students dislike school. It is good to encourage students to go to extracurricular activities, but not to force them. In high school I intend to be on one of my school's sports teams, but I am making that decision on my own. Besides, maybe you dont enjoy any of the after school activities. I am already forced to come to school for seven hours a day, and adding another hour or two on top of that would be very tiring and stressful. Doing extracurricular activities are great for you, but not when you are being forced. Just thinking about staying after school for an extra hour or two stresses me out.

Someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal. If this ever actually became a rule, It would be followed by more than just one school. It would either be countywide, statewide, or nationwide. I am not saying that I agree with this rule but if this was ever passed, the principal wouldnt have the power to force students to do this. The principal does not have the ability to pretty much extend our school day. That would be something decided by higher up people, like the governor, president, or board of education. The principal just enforces the rules, not creates them.

This rule would make many students angry. It wouldnt make anyone happy, because the students that want to do after school activitiess, can still do them just as easily. No one gets any benefits from this rule. Making students participate in after school activities would probably encourage students to cut class more often, and maybe just not even show up to school at all. You can be a well rounded person without having to attend after school activities. Again, I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's rights to leave after the final bell rings, students should decide what they with to do after school, piling more school related activities on top of school would be very stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal.                ";0
"Is the Face on Mars a mesa or is it made by alien life? Well, the answer to that world-wide question is that it is a mesa. In other words, a natural landform that has been there or been made over time by the planets rotation. I strongly believe that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform, because we have almost like it on Earth, there are no signs of alien life in the pictures or scientific research, and the pictures taken, show that there are shadows that create a facial look in the natural landform.

First off, we have a natural landform located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The one on Mars is almost equivalent to the one here on our planet. In paragraph 12, it states, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is plainly saying that the one on planet Mars could just be a lava dome of some sort just like the one here on Earth.

Also, there are no signs of alien life through the pictures taken from the cameras. How could this alien life we talk about create this Face, when there is no evidence of this alien life? The pictures were taken mutiple times in different years to make sure of this. They had people questioning, so they did further research. For example in paragraph number eight, ""...peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by daze."" The skeptics that wanted the benifits of actually finding alien life wanted actual proof that it is merily only a mesa. They ende up being proved that it is only a mesa.

To also say, the photographs that were studied have been intereprted. They have been interepreted to the point that they can pin-point certain material. They proved that by when they said that is merily shadows that the mesa has, from depth, that create the face like look. For example in paragraph number three, it states ""The captain noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" The images were showing that there were some dips in this mesa that created it to look as if it were an actual face.

There are people who say,"" Just because the cameras say that there is no life on Mars, doesn't mean that there is no life."" To prove that wrong, it states in paragraph number 11, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Also later on in the paragraph, ""...if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian pyramids... you could see what they were."" Meaning if there was any 3-d image, it would have been picked up and been able to ananlyze. The Face is obviously a natural landform that has been there from the beginnging. Also, people used to say and still say "" look at the man on the moon."" There is no man on the moon, there is a mesa that was shaped that looks like a Face. The Face n Mars is just another incident of what happend with the moon.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform like the one here on earth and the one that appears on the face of the moon. I strongly hold my belief that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform because there is almost an exact replica here on earth, there are no sientific signs of life, and the pictures that were taken, that have been analized, show that shadows create the face. Will there one day be life somewhere else besides Earth. I will never know, but as of right now and the scientific records that are based on this essay, this Face that people say might be made by aliens is not logical. This Face on Mars is a mesa. Once you can find scientific data that proves there is life on earth, than everything said for years ca be proven wrong. But as of right now, no.";0
"Dear Principal,

In school, grades and sports play an important roll in the future of the students. Sports are meant to keep young people out of trouble and are enjoyable to many people. In order to keep kids motivated to do better in school, their grades should have to be acceptable. I agree that a B average should be the lowest grade a student should maintain in order to continue in their sport or activity.

The future of the students is more important than the extra activities, in my opinion. If the student cant keep the grade at a B average and try their hardest to complete their school work, I don't think they need the sport as a distraction.

When the students reach adulthood, their test scores will most likely effect their career choices, not how well they were athletically. To get young people to succeed, sometimes they need a little push in the right direction.

To motivate students to do better in school, i believe grades should effect whether they can participate in certain sports or not. Education is the way to a better life.

Sincerely,

"Teen's Driving with Phones

Teens should not be on their phones while driving it is dangerous. When driving all you attention should be on what's in front of you not what's on your phone. That split second look down at your phone could be fatal, cause you don't know what's going on around you and you could hit someone or run off the road. In some states it's against the law to drive while on your phone, the consequences are severe and could handicap you from some jobs.

Driving with a phone is not okay unless it's being used as a navigation tool. Texting and driving isn't something that should be common it's a distraction . Calling is okay if its hands free calling and you can still stay focused on the road and talk at the same time. Things will not change teens are still going to disobey what the law says and drive with their phones in hand without a care in the world unless the law enforcement cracks down on it.

All in all teens should not be driving with the possession of their phone. The ,aw should crack down and make it harder for kids to drive on the phone.   ";0
"Albert Schweitzer was a prominent figure in the medical and humanitarian fields, known for his dedication to improving the lives of others. One of his famous quotes was ""Example is the only thing in influencing others,"" which suggests that the best way to influence others is through direct action and setting a positive example. However, I disagree with this statement and believe that influencing someone does not necessarily require being a direct example for them.

While it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. For instance, people can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others even if they are not physically present or directly observing them. This can happen through media, such as television and the internet, which allow people to learn about and be inspired by the actions and behaviors of others.

Furthermore, even when people are directly observing a positive example, it is not always the case that they will be influenced by it. People have their own unique experiences and perspectives, and they may not always be able to relate to or understand the experiences of others. Additionally, people may be influenced by negative examples or by the absence of positive examples, which can be just as powerful in shaping their behavior and attitudes.

In conclusion, while it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. People can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others through media, and even by negative examples or the absence of positive examples. Ultimately, the most effective way to influence others is to understand their unique experiences and perspectives, and to provide them with the support and resources they need to achieve their goals.";1
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Many people think that the Face was created by aliens, but this is not correct. There is no proof that shows that the face was created by aliens, but there is much information to back up the fact that the Face is just a natural landform.

In the passage, Garvin says, ""'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added. 'So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the gorund or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'"" This shows that even when people from NASA zoomed in on the face to get a better look at it, they couldn't find any sign of alien life which means that there is a very low possibility that there are aliens that could've done this.

Another reason that shows that aliens couldn't have done this is when the passage says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting when the image first apperared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" If scientists at NASA have studied this face and taken many pictures but still can't find any type of alien life, then there isn't any.

The last piece of evidence that shows that aliens didn't make the Face is when the text says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Gavin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" Many scientists would let the public know if they were any signs of aliens making the Face to keep us informed so the people wouldn't constantly be thinking and talking about it every day.

There is much information to back up the fact that the Face is just a landform. The public started to make up theories that made other people talk about it constantly, but scientists from NASA proved them wrong by showing them pictures on the Internet that there are no traces of aliens on or around the Face.";0
"I believe that it is best to ask a multitude of people for their opinion before making a decision. Having multiple opinions instead of just one leads to a better understanding of the situation, along with a variety of choices and reassurance in the decision. There have been many times in life that I have had to make an important decision. For instance, during my first year of middle school, I had to decide on what to do for a longtime friend who had chosen to prioritize her other friends over me. At the time, I chose to ask three people for advice; a mutual friend, an outside friend, and my mom. During the process, I learned that there were several advantages to seeking advice from multiple people instead of limiting myself to one.

Firstly, I was able to understand the situation more fully from the feedback that I got from different people. Initially, I had felt resentment towards my friend for choosing her other friends over me. However, from listening to different opinions, I was able to put together a better, more unbiased view of the situation. The mutual friend that I had talked to mostly shared the same opinion as me, while the outside friend was more sympathetic towards my friend. On the other hand, my mom had a completely different opinion from any of us. She thought that my friend wasn't choosing her other friends over me, per say, but just learning to get along with others in our age group as well. By putting the various opinions together, I was able to acknowledge that the fault did not fully lie with my friend and that there could be a misunderstanding.

Secondly, I had a wider range of choices due to having asked many different people. Individually, I was only offered a single solution that they believed would be the best choice of action. As a total, however, I had three different choices because each person had offered a choice each. The mutual friend felt that I should remain passive and make a final decision to either keep or break our friendship based on how the situation resolved itself. On the contrary, the outside friend believed that I should directly confront my friend and work out the misunderstanding. Finally, my mom thought that I could remain friends with her, but just not as closely as before. As a result, I chose to remain distant friends with her instead of making any drastic decisions. From having a variety of choices, I felt that I had a lot of freedom in making my decision.

Lastly, from asking for advice from multiple people, I felt more reassured that I had truly weighed all my options before settling on one. I placed trust in those I had asked for advice and myself when making my final decision. Although I may have remained uncertain if I had only asked one person, I was confident in my choice. I had taken the time and effort to speak with three vastly different people with differing viewpoints and I knew that I had done all that I could in order to ensure that I wouldn't be making a mistake. It was easy for me to finalize my decision because of the certainty that I felt regarding my choice.

In conclusion, I believe that seeking multiple opinions is beneficial to making a decision because it leads to a mostly unbiased view of the problem, a wide range of choices, and confidence in the decision. Although there may be exceptions to this, it was true in my experiences. There is no shame in asking for help in making a decision. After all, even the wisest can have trouble with making personal choices. When encountered with a troubling decision, it is best to ask for multiple opinions from various people. I learned many lessons from the experience of making a choice about my friend, but the most important one was that asking for advice from a variety of people can lead to a better decision than one you may make from one person's advice. ";0
"Electoral college is a unfar way to vote for a president becasue it make the government officals bias to the more popular states such as Flordia or Texas. I think that we should get rid of the electoral college because it make the smaller states feel left out compared to larger states. If the president was elected by the population not by the ""Government"" how would it change the way the U.S. worked today.

The text informs me that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors who in turn elect the president. In my opinion I think that there should be more than 3 votes or 4 votes for a state to elect a president. If the United States went to a population voting system the elections would be more fair to people that live in the smaller states. The text also informs me that in 2000 the U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush wont the election, receiving 271 electoral votes the Gore's 266. If the case of Gore losing the election a year later Bush went to war on Iraq.

If the United States went to a population voting system the percentage of votes would increase dramaticly to cause a honest election. If the election where to happen next election cycle I think that it would change the way the United States votes. People are fooled by the president when they say ""I will lower taxes, Protect the environment, or Stop the wars we are in"" I thnk that it's a trick for them to win the votes they need to win. If the population voted for the president i think that the United States would not be in debt.

The reason I think that the voting regulations is broken is that smaller states like Rhoad Island is a state that gets 3-10 votes and Claifonia gets 55 votes. If the only thing that make people happy is to be heard by the bigger people in life. If you where a 18 year old kid in a small state trying to make a  new product that could help millions but your in that state that wont let you be heard by the rest of the country.    ";0

I have to arn you, you might face dangerous situations.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you would be helping animals that weres shipped overseas. You would be helping animals such as horses, young cows and mules. You would be feeding the animals, giving them water clean their stalls and you would have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats to the lower holds of the ship. If you join the program you would also be able to visit exciting places and countries, I got to visit the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Some places I visited were Europe, China, Greece, Italy and Crete. One of the most exciting things I have ever done was when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Itlay. Another reason why you should join is because, when you're on the ship you get to do activities such as playing baseball, volleyball, Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and if you want you can read.

I have to warn you, you could get hurt because when I was aboard on the ship one day, I slid down a slippery laddery on my backside, my heart raced as I shot feet towards an openingon the side of the ship. Luckilly a small strip of metal along the edge of the ship stopped me from sliding and keept me from flying aboard into the Atlantic Ocean. I was happy to be alive, but I couldn't work for a couple of days because I had cracked ribs. Even though you might face some dangerous situations when you join this program you still get to, help animals, visit exciting places and countries and do fun activities while you are on the ship. Please join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you would be doing a good thing and your family and friends would be proud that you are helping animals and the community.";0
"I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.

Participating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.

An extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.

I positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular. They don't even have to take up that much time. There are an amazing amount of opportunities and benefits that come from them that shouldn't be passed. It could just be something to do after school, or it could be what you love to do. An extracurricular is great for everybody.";0
"The ""face"" on mars is a natural landform and was not made by aliens. I know this because it's just a rock formation. The second reason is NASA would want there to be life on mars because it would benefit them. Finally because the shadows give the appearance of looking like a face.

My first reason is it's just a rock formation. In the artcle, it says global surveyor flew over Cydonia and snap photos of it. These pictures were 10 times sharper than the original. Also these showed that it was just a natural landform. It is the mar equivalent of a butte or Mesa.

Now I know what some of you are thinking, ""What if NASA is hiding something. Well my next reason is NASA would benefit by finding aliens on mars. In the text it said that while defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an alien civillzation. This shows that they would embrace having found aliens because they could make money. NASA wouldn't be hiding anything because they would be missing out. In the text it even said that authors resoned it would be a good way to engage the public an attract more attention to mars.

Finally, the face only lookes like that because of shadows. The article says the face only comes from shadows. It gave the illusion of having eyes, a mouth, and a nose. People have traveled as far as we could get; with the best camera and saw that it was just a normal rock formation. In face we have many of these same mesa and butte on earth.

The face on mars is is a natural landform and was not made by aliens. This is because it's just a normal rock formation. The next reason is NASA would want there to be life on Mars because it would beneft them. Finally, The ""face"" is formed because of the shadows on the Mesa. For all these reasons the face on mars was not made by aliens, but is just a regular rock formation";0
"Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Requiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social. Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.

These activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.

Another benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students. When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.

In conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.";0
"Dear Principal,

I was informed that you have two choices about cell phone policy. I have read both and I have came to the conclusion you should chose policy 1.

Policy 1 is the better choice. Policy 1 gives permission to students to be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch periods but not in class time. Students need to be able to have their cell phones because maybe they need to call for a ride after school. If there is a fight and someone is hurt they can call the ambulance with their cell phones. Going to the office for a phone would take to long if the kid is seriously injured. Phones are a way communication we really are not doing anything wrong by having them. This is why policy one is the better choice.

Policy 2 states to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all. This is not a good choice because if this happens then students will be angered and sneak phones in anyways. Students will be using them in class because the teachers will not be able to see. You might say that kids will use their phones in class with policy 2 but if they have time to use their phones during passing periods then there will be no reason for them to use it in class. This is why policy 2 is the wrong choice.

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME";0
"Should people who are operating a automobile be able to use any technology while driving?

I believe that all phones should be put away while in an operating mobile. Most accidents are caused because of cellphone usage while driving. Mainly, because their attention is on other things, and it causes car insurance rates to rise. Besides that, protecting pedestrians and other motorists should be more important than a cell phone.

These days accidents are mostly caused by cell phones usage while operating a vehicle. Statistics show that one out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused from cell phone usage while driving (edgarsnyder. com). You can admit, it is hard to keep focus on the road when a phone is present. It is believed that phones shouldn't be in use while driving a vehicle. It is very dangerous for you and everyone else around you. There is always a chance of danger and with distraction from your phone there is a higher chance for an accident.

Secondly, when driving and using technology, usually your mind wonders off into another state. Driving with distractions from a noisey cellphone is kind of like driving under the influence of drugs. It's just too much going on at one time which could also cause an accident.

When the light turns greens and you're on your phone, what do you think happens? Traffic accidents. Or what about when you and someone else are waiting at a stop sign and you're busy on your cell phone and ""boom"" you hit them? There was a possibility you could have ended their life. That phone call or text message could've been responded to when you got to your destination. Am I right? Now a days, most people are afraid of traveling on the road because one they are afraid they may get hit, two they might hit someone, or three there's traffic somewhere. My mother won't even let me drive because she's hearing so many stories on how teens are losing their lives because of their cellphones. Would you want to let your child drive on a dangerous road knowing that there are people not paying attention to the road? No I don't think so.

Also, insurance rates are rising throughout the nation, so many accidents are around and typically they are because of a phone. There are many ways of causing an accident but ""Driver error is most often the result of ""distracted driving."" By far the most common cause of driver distraction is the use of cell phones"" according to Dr. Daniel Landers. But why is a phone more important than your safety? It shouldn't be. There are now many states in the United States with the ""hands free"" law to prevent people from using cellphones while operating the vehicle and so far, there have been less accidents involving phone usage.

In conclusion, laws have been enacted to protect all citizens from distracted drivers.

Specifically drivers who use their cellphones responsibly with hands free devices ensures that all citizens get to their destination safer than when these laws weren't in effect. As a result, drivers can expect decreased insurance costs in the future.   ";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Do you think it would be fare for students to participate in any sports or activities with a C average? Hmm! Well i think it is fare. Therefore, i believe students should be able to participate in any sports or activities because its healthy for them, it'll make their school much exciting, and they can get scholarships.

To begin with, playing sports is healthy for students. They'll be energetic and fell great instead of being lazy pigs just sitting around in their house while they can be out here in school playing sports. Also, they can become more muscular by playing sports or any other activity and they'll be in great shape. When students don't play sports they start to weaken out and aren't in good shape because their bodies aren't moving around as much. So TEACHER_NAME would you want one of your students getting sick by not playing sports or any other activity because of their grades in school?

Furthermore, if students are in any sports or in activities it'll make their school much exciting and fun.

Once it comes to a game there will be thousands of people that will be at the game to support those students that are in any sports or activities. Also it'll ma";0
"Curfews are a common practice among parents and guardians of teenagers. The main reason for this practice is to ensure that teenagers are safe and secure at all times. In this essay, I will analyze why curfews are beneficial to teenagers, examine the discipline that would result from curfews, compare the benefits of curfews with the alternatives of not implementing them, explore how curfews would improve the attitude and behavior of teens in the workplace and in public, discuss how curfews can prevent teenagers from getting into trouble, and evaluate the impact that a 10pm curfew would have.

One of the main benefits of curfews is that they help to ensure that teenagers are safe and secure. Teenagers are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse, bullying, and sexual activity when they are not supervised by adults. Curfews provide a way for parents and guardians to monitor their teenagers' activities and ensure that they are not engaging in any harmful behaviors. Additionally, curfews can help to prevent teenagers from being exposed to negative influences such as peer pressure and gang activity.

Another benefit of curfews is that they can improve the discipline of teenagers. When teenagers are given a curfew, they must learn to manage their time and prioritize their responsibilities. This can help to develop a sense of responsibility and self-discipline that can be beneficial in many areas of life. Additionally, curfews can help to prevent teenagers from becoming overly reliant on their parents and guardians, which can be beneficial in developing independence and self-sufficiency.

Alternatives to curfews, such as allowing teenagers to stay out late or not implementing any curfew at all, can have negative consequences. Allowing teenagers to stay out late can increase their exposure to negative influences and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Additionally, not implementing any curfew can lead to a lack of structure and discipline in a teenager's life, which can be harmful in many ways.

Curfews can also improve the attitude and behavior of teens in the workplace and in public. When teenagers are given a curfew, they must learn to manage their time and prioritize their responsibilities. This can";1
"Zroom! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.

There is only so much space on earth and alot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of near-record pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

In conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although its ok to use them in moderation; they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment.                                    ";0
"Distance learning, taking online classes from home, is becoming more popular in this new generation of technological advancements. Using online classes, video conferences, and online resources, schools are officially starting to offer distance learning to their students. However, students do not benefit from distance learning because it provides less help and makes school more difficult, lessens kids' social interactions, and is harder to accomplish due to distractions in one's home.

Distance learning does not benefit students in school because it provides less help from teachers and instructors. When students learn new material or are struggling at home, they have no one-on-one help from teachers. Not only does the lack of hands-on support make classes harder, but it also causes confusion and questions from children that never get answered. The situation negatively affects kids because a understanding of their classes sets them up for worse grades and makes future classes more difficult. Also, another negative aspect of distance learning is that students do not receive a personalized learning environment. When studying online, teachers have a worse understanding of how specific students learn. For example, some kids learn more efficiently with lectures, drawings and pictures, or videos. However, through online classes these distinctions are not possible and all students learn from the same videos or conferences. Finally, an important aspect of school is the atmosphere. Learning with other students and teachers, sharing ideas, and working together to advance one's understanding is a very important part of going to school. However, a consequence of distance learning is that you are not able to partake in these groups and classes, which results in the loss of this valuable experience.

Taking online classes and not physically going to school provides kids with less social interactions and relationships while also taking away important social life lessons. When students do not go to school they are unable to spend time with other children and adults, ultimately resulting in less friendships and personal connections with teachers or other adults. The loss of friendships and potential mentors in one's life is very detrimental to their future, as these relationships can help one grow and become a better student and person. Another important aspect of school that distance learning strips from students is group projects and assignments. When working in a group, one creates friendships and important life lessons about how to work with others to accomplish a task. However, during online classes students lose the opportunity to develop these group skills. Finally, not developing these friendships and connections in early life leads to the lack of proper social skills later in life. Not being consistently exposed to other kids and adults may lead to isolation and less relationships in the future.

Distance learning is not beneficial to all students because some home lives are unstable and distracting and others do not have access resources necessary for online schooling. Some students have very chaotic and hard lives at home, which may include family or economic problems. These unstable conditions in a household make it very hard to study and take classes in this atmosphere, which is a major downside of distance learning. Also, in these conditions you are not provided with the the guidance and discipline from teachers like in school which makes homework and classes much more difficult. Another large setback is that there are many students who are unable to pay for or provide the resources necessary for distance learning. Not every family is able to consistently access internet or have laptop computers or cameras needed for video conferences and online classes.

Technology is very useful and can positively impact student's learning during school, however, distance learning, attending classes from home, is not beneficial to students. It leads to the lack of personal help and guidance from teachers, the negative impact on children's social skills and relationships, and because it is not available for all students. ";0
"Generic_Name is given a summer project by her teacher and is annoyed over having to do work over the summer, but once she actually starts the project she realizes it helps her remember material and comes to school feeling more prepared. A teacher gives students a project to do over the summer knowing exactly what the students need in order to continue learning and become prepared for the coming school year. Although receiving work to do over the summer for students may be bothersome, teachers understand the requirements students should meet in order to learn efficiently throughout the summer so that they will not forget important material. Teachers should be designing the summer projects rather than students themselves because they understand what material is needed to learn, they have a broader outlook on what all students can do, and they will provide a more challenging project.

Although a student may argue that students should be the ones designing the summer projects because as a student, students will know what will be good for other students. Being the same age group may help in developing a project that will help other students learn over the summer but consequently that is not the case. Students are all different when it comes to learning techniques and when coming up with a project, it may either be difficult or too easy for other classmates. Work provided by students will vary in results and become unreliable. Teachers know what is needed to learn and therefore give students a summer projects that will be efficient enough to help students during the summer.

In order to be prepared for the coming school year, students will need know what material is necessary to remember. Teachers know exactly what material be taught and need to make sure students do not forget basic information. When coming up with a project for students a English teacher will know which basic information is needed to remember, such as knowing basic vocabulary terms to distinguish while reading, Students will easily forget terms and struggle when coming back to school and needing to restudy these basic terms, it also takes away more time for teachers to teach. Teachers are the ones teaching the material and understand the necessities students are gonna need to remember for the upcoming year.

With that, to make sure students actually do learn, it is necessary that students are given a project that will be helpful for the majority. Teachers have the broader outlook on what exactly the majority of students should be learning and will help students learn over the summer that way they will feel more prepared for the coming school year. Teachers will ensure that by looking through test averages, seeing where students did worst and best at and reflect that on the summer project. By looking through what students did best and worst at teacher will provide a helpful project for the summer to make sure students learn in the summer. Students will have the lower hand in this situation because of lack of knowledge towards what other classmates did well and bad on.

Summer projects will only help students learn if the project actually requires students to think and work efficiently. Teachers will be sure students are given a project they cannot just wing and do quickly. Teachers could give essays or book reports that way students will actually be more hands on and not lack off doing the summer projects. Giving students a more challenging or thinking based summer project will not only prevent laziness but will make the students feel more productive with their summer. The boost of productivity will give more confidence to the students as in something that could be too easy to quickly finish. Teachers understand that more thinking based work or more work will help students learn more efficiently and be more productive. Giving them a simple project or a project that involves little work will only increase the chances of students lacking off and therefore result in nothing being learned.

In conclusion, summer projects are given to students so that they continue to learn in the summer and become more prepared for the coming school year. Whether or not these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, it is easier to say they should be teacher-designed. Teachers understand the material and the students and therefore will provide a more efficient summer project. When being able to understand what is required for a summer project, teachers will have the better understanding on ensuring the project will be efficient for students to learn. ";0
"Have you ever been sick just because you went outside, maybe it was because of the air pollution that thousand of cars give everyday. So don't you you ever wonder how it would be like if there were few cars, would it make a difference on the world. Many people are strating projects to see how it would be like to have no car. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up there cars a become surburban pioneers. They walk or ride there bicycle were they need to go. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said that ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". So should't we try having few cars around. Not only i vauban promothing a free car zone but also in the United States, the environmental protection agency are promoting ""car reduced"" communities to reduce the smog on the world.

Did you know that Paris ban driving due to smog. Paris was typically had more smog than other Europeans Capitals but duo to the banding many people had there car impounded for their reaction to the fine and conestion was down to 6 percent in the capital of France. BOGOTA, Columbia strated a program call a car-free day, millions of columbia hiked, biked, skated or took bus to work, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jam. The goal of this program is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Many people were happy because the parks and sports center have bloomed throughout the city the ,uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broed, smooth sidewalks. Also rush hours were restriction have dramatically cut traffic. Would you love to ride the car with your frieds instead of the old same rutine of being alone all the mornings on your way to school. Like kids that make new friends when they ride the bus to school wouldn't like to meet new people like that too.

Many people don't like riding their bicycle to work because they would get dirty. but isn't it better to be dirty than live in air polluted word that affects your life. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent inib the united states. Fewer people are buying less cars years is a start that people are not depending are cars that much. A study shows that cars driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Should we help the world and reduce global warming. We still cars but we should retuced haw many we have. Lets improve our safety by reducing have much we use cars.                                                        ";0
Truthfully i don't really think this kind of technology would actually work. A persons emotions are determined by that person only. A computer no matter how many upgrades it has could never fully understand a persons emotions or even how they feel for that matter. A person can have many facial exprecions. They can show many feelings from happiness to saddness,from frustration to anger. If you look hard enough you can tell how someone is feeling by looking at their face but you don't need a computer to do it for you. Yes some computers are advanced enough to be able to tell how a person is feeling but they can never actually know what emotion they have. Sometimes faciale expercions can be unpredictable but if you pay attention you will be able to tell how someone is truly feeling. It mostly takes more then technology to tell how a person is feeling. It takes a real person with real eye's to really see. If somehow the kind of technology that can be able to tell how a person is feeling through facial expresions was developed then that would be impressive. However no matter how advanced the tech could be i believe that only real people posses the real ability to tell how a person could feel. That is how i feel about the facial expression examining technology being developed. ;0
"I agree with kids having to do one extracurricular activity,because it gets a lot more students involved in the community. It can also lead to kids living a healthy lifestyle. There could be a potential basketball player that does not know what he is capable of and he could find it through sports. When they work in the yearbook they can find someone who is new to the school and make them feel welcomed. They can find things they never knew that they liked. This can lead to a better school and community.

When a student is forced to do something first they don't like it but then it can lead to many different things in the future. For example, you don't know if you like something until you try it. It is the same way with sports. What if there is a kid that plays basketball for fun but he does not want to try out. Now he can try out and if he really likes it he can furthermore better his skills at it. What if because he had to do the bare minimum of one activity he gets many scholarships in high school and goes to the NBA. Just because of that one activity.

Students have a tuff time fitting in sometimes and it can help by doing extracurricular activities. For example, both students both like taking pictures but they don't think anything of it. They both join the yearbook program which takes pictures of students and faculty. Then they meet and then they become good friends. Just because of that one activity that they had to do. They become a wedding photographers.

Let's say a student wants to become a governor and they see student council and they join it. Now when they join they become president of the school. This program would teach them how to listen to the school and make fundraisers and help the school out. This program might make them want to go in depth in their career choice and make them want to join in high school because they enjoyed it so much. Just because they did the bare minimum of one choice. They become the governor of Virginia.

Students may not like being forced to do things. They choose to work for it though. Being asked to participate in one activity may seem cruel or not nice enough. But it opens doors to many things in life to different things. Just because they did the bare minimum of one choice.           ";0
"Many people might think that the face on Mars was created by aliens and many others might think that it is just a natural landform.

There is no proof for any of the rumors.

People have had clues about them.

Some say that it looks like an Egypitan Pharaoph, others say it looks like a river from Idaho.

The face has become so popular that it was starred in movies, magazines, books and talk shows.

It was so popular because it was unusual.

NASA knew once they showed the public the picture they would attract more attention to the planet Mars.

The Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia and took a picture that came out more clear than the first picture that NASA took.

To get the picture was hard work.

They usually do not pass over Cydonia very often.

There is a spacecraft that will fly over the location and scan it like a fax machine.

The picture of the face may mean different things to people and some may have different opinions about it.

One person said it looked like a mesa formed by lava.

If NASA done more research about the face in Cydonia they might be able to figure out what it is and what caused it.

Unitl someone says what it really is, it will just be a big mystery.

You can spot the head shaped figure from two miles away.

Photographing the landform became important to NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor.

They also felt that it was important for taxpayers.

No matter how cloudy or hard it was to see and capture the face, they still made it work.

The crew in the Mars Global Surveyor said there were alien markings that were hidden.

When Malin's team tried again to find another photo they went on a cloudless day and used the maximum resolution and got another picture.

When they used the maximum resolution you could see things that were even on the ground such as planes or pyramids.

They also stated that the landform was almost the same as a butte.

The landorms were common around the American West.     ";0

"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" when you hear this title most people would be either 1.) excited or 2.) questioning this. As I read the passage I noticed how the article put both pros and cons too this in my opinion I think this development towards these cars is awful. The reason why I say this is because I think all drivers should take responsibility and drive how they're doing right now so many things can go wrong with having a car who only alerts you when you either pull in and out of a driveway. Or when there is complicated issues ahead , for example in order to have these types of cars around.

You would have too be really exact on the senors that are being installed into every single car that is shipped out , if something goes wrong while doing this process and someone ends up purchasing the car. It can cause them their life or someone else's if they end up losing complete control and creating a bigger situation. So many companies have tried getting these types of cars created but something always either goes wrong somewhere or it's just too expensive to install.

It also speaks about how the sensors make sure the driver is keeping a hold of the wheel , but what if the driver is under the influence and cannot take over when a emergency occurs ? Will the car not go anywhere or will it continue to drive. I don't think the states of California, Nevada,Florida,and the District of Columbia should allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. They're still unsafe have not correctly gotten everything they need in them if they were to distribute its still considered dangerous. I'm not for the idea but if the manufactures are considering this I think this is going to have to be thought about a lot and take time considering a 6 year project at least. But this is why I believe that making ""Driverless Cars"" is not such a good idea.";0
"The Google cofounder Sergey Brin thinks that the genius idea of driverless cars will be around by the year of 2020. This would mean there would be less accidents if it is put out into the world when it working properly.

Driverless cars would cause less wrecks and be safer to pedestrians. If you were drinking you could put the driverless part of the car on so there wouldn't be a problem getting you home. Many accidents are caused by people that are tired, drunk, or under the influence of something. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This quote shows that alert drivers would be the best for our safety, but the drivers not alert or under the influence of something could cause serious damage to someone or something which is why the car should have a setting for the human to drive and one setting for the car to drive.

Driverless cars is a great idea and have some flaws at the moment buy in a couple of years it will run perfectly or close to perfect so it can keep people safe. This would cause less accidents in car related things.";0
"Dear Principal,

Students should do community service. They should because, it would really help our environment. If students would take an hour out of their time to volunteer to clean up the beaches in the summer, tutor kids, volunteer and a homeless shelter, or just anything to help people in need or the environment. It would really be helpful and it would save the planet and people. People are sometimes just to lazy to do something like this. Otherwise, they make up excuses like ""I have to much homework"". People that don't really have time because they have a religion group they go to, or just because they have church or something. Most churches have a volunteer group you could do. Or else the church as a whole does something community service like.

Some people believe that they shouldn't do community service because it take up to much time. People sit at home with their TV's on all day, everyday. They will sit at home playing video games or on the computer. What they don't know is that, that is really hurting our environment right now. People are cutting trees down everyday. Trees give off oxygen and without oxygen we wouldn't be here. Go out and plant a tree. That would help our environment a whole lot. Even if you just plant some flowers that would still help.

Taking community service isn't just a punishment, its fun for some people. Some people like to save the plant. Some people like to help other people. I know that i would like to help other people. But i don't get the opportunity to do community service, because i play a lot of sports. But yes, I do have a lot of free time and i wish i could do community service. Community service isn't just about helping the environment and helping people. It's also about meeting new people. When you meet new people that can sometimes change your actions. And changing your actions into doing community service, is a good thing.

I agree with having students do community service 100%. I think that it would be a good thing to do to help our planet, to help people in need, and also to help your self.";0
"Dear Principle,

Due to the recent fascination with cell phones and all the new technology, I can definitely see why you need the change in policy. You see, allowing cell phones as long as they are turned off for class and the ability to use them for free times, helps make a connection with your students. No one wants a principle that is too controlling, as in Policy 2, and you can't have students' cell phones ring all the time because it's distracting to the learning environment. That's why Policy 1 is a great compromise and a choice that benefits both sides.

If you did take cell phones away, you would create an awful tension between you and your students. People would be angry that one of their rights was taken away in a matter of seconds. What used to be acceptance would become anger and resistance. By banning cell phones you would make it seem as if bringing your cell phone would make you more of a rebel. Either way, this new policy would make students even more inclined to bring their cell phones.

Now let's say you picked Policy 1. People don't like change, but this time it isn't so big, which therefore means that people would be willing to accept it. By doing this you don't seem like a dictator and it's not pure chaos so this is an amazing choice that would create a bond of understanding. Not everyone is understanding as you may wish, but think of it as a life lesson for the students. Life isn't perfect. People just have to deal with that.

You may seem reluctant to this new age of technology and allowing cell phones but the truth is cell phones aren't all bad. I personally know many students that use there phone to get the homework assignments they missed or a calculator or even to check the time! When you are sick you need to call someone to get the homework. If you banned cell phones from school, it would take a lot longer to get the assignments. It's true that we also play games on our phones but it's to escape the shackles of society every once in a while.

Policy 1 is the best choice. It creates a compromise between your students that is fair. Students would agree that this is the best choice by far. Whether they like it or not, this is a choice and people will accept that. It's not to big of a difference either. People will adjust and life will go on. It's a choice that benefits both sides. These are the reasons you should pick Policy #1.

Sincerely, A student of yours";0
"Receiving advice from other is beneficial. Hearing other people's opinions can give you different option's on ways to solve problems. Asking for advice from more than one person could give you more choices on how you would like to solve a situation.

Getting more advice from other. You can see what everyone tell you and go off of the most common words. They all said or just go off of what the one person said. Although having more advice is better than one person advice. When you ask for advice you got to trust that, that person to not give you bad advice or lie to you and tell you bad advice.

After you gain advice from your friends,family members or others you could trust that will give good advice . You could us that advice to see if that would be a great idea for your choice on your situation . With how you want to execute that problem and or situation you might have . We all would like the best awnser so we could chose the best way to make a choice on whatever you are doing.

If you had two game your could buy and you couldnt make a choice. You could ask a friend or family member on thought on the game. If your brother said that one of the games if fun. Then your friend said the other game was better. You could ask another friend on their thought. Then ask with is game is better in your oppion. Then you could go off what he said beaches you got more advice on that game you chould purchase .

That is why receiving advice form multiple people is better than reciving advice from your sefl or just from one person.";0
"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of a qualified citizens. Each candidate running for President has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. You help choose your state electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. I think we should keep Electoral Colleges. It gives people a chance, help with responsibility, and it is competitive. Thats why i think we should keep Electoral College.

Initially, it gives everyone in the political group a chance. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: on for each member in the House of Representitaves plus two for your Senators. The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Everyone in the political group votes. That means if you already did'nt ruin your reputation you have a chance at becoming the president because, everyone on at one point and time in the political party is equal. It also make sure everyon is heard, it makes everyone useful for something. The Electoral College gives everybody a chance which is probably the best detail about the system.

In addition, Electoral College also hekps with responsibility. Laws are vary on how the electors are selected and what thier responsibilities are. It can either take away responsibilities or give more resonsibilities. This can help people out alot, people won't get task that they can't handle and other people won't get task that would bore them or would be to easy from. It also gies people restrictions that had already had problems or that had did something something that was'nt alowd. This is helpful to those who are'nt very skilled at something, those who are probably to skilled at something, and those who are probably just in the middle. This is also another great detail why we should keep Electoral College.

Finially, it is competative. Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. This would make would people work harder and strive for higher expectations. The competitiveness level would be even higher becuase everyone is going for the same goal, this would make thing even more exciting to watch and here about. So the Electoral College dose not only just make the system good but it also makes it exciting and competative, which would helpe people want to learn more about the election. Thats another big reason why we should keep Electoral College.

In conclusion, Electoral College is very good. It gives people chance to strive for greatness, it helps people with responsibility, and it is very competitave. I think we should keep Electoral College it is a great achievement to our country and is a advantage to our election. It lets everyone be heard, it teaches people how to deal with the roles they have to play the system, and it makes people work harder. I think Electoral College is good for us and we would be dumb not to keep it.                                            ";0
"The Face on Mars

By jimmy

NASA`s had send a spacecraft called Viking 1. Many of the people that were working on this were think it was something else. When it came out 1976 many peolpe think it was made by aliens. But on one know that it was. So it be came an icon for the plant mars. Many people think it was aliens that made the face or hills that from the face on mars. 22 years later Mars Global surveyor had a spacecaft that was going aronud mars to the face but when they did they take the image. Many were happy to see other image. But it did not came a clear as they what it to be. But what i think it could be is that a rock may crash into mars and made the face. But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.

"Is there ever going to be a day when you can not go outside and enjoy some fresh air- enjoying nature and the beauty it provides? What if the next day we go outside and everyone has to to wear a mask or something over their face because the air is no longer heathy to breath due to too much emmission from automobiles? Luckily, there are some was to prevent this from ever becoming a reality in every day life. At first, the thought of limiting car usage may seem unappealing especially considering the fact on how great an affect our cars have in our livers. Yet, not all those affects are good ones. Everywhere around the world, people use some kind of automobile to get from point A to point B and so on but maybe there are other solutions. In the first source, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, it states that limiting car useage is doable and done comfortably. The source states that in Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there.

Is it actually possable to live life regularly without using a car regularly? This is one question that might be asked by a lot of people hearing about the idea of car limitation. In source 2, it tells us that Paris, after days of near-record pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the air in the global city. On one day, all mororists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home and on the following day the same applied to odd numbered plates or suffer a 22-euro ($31) fine. The source states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. With that aside, Congestion was down by 60 percent in Paris. Knowing this information, it is a lot easier to realize just how dramatic of a change limitation of cars would be to most people; though, the benifits were dramatic aswell.

Of course it would seem to be way too impractical to up and abandon all cars and walk and/or bike everywhere. Alternative transportation is the key, at least in Bogota, Columbia. Source 3 states that its been the third straight year cars have been banned with only busses and taxies permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capitol city of 7 million. Violators of the ban were faces $25 fines for the goal to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog.

Considering all this information provided by the sources, car limitation would be very benificial to the earth and the problems of pollution we are all facing. Presenting alternative transprotation and a ban on cars would be a very dramatic switch of lifestyle to basically everyone but it seems, at the rate air quality and smog is becoming more and more a problem, that it would be worth the switch. If this ever does become an everyday lifestyle, it certanly will not happen in just a week. The switch would most likely gradually work its way into everyones lifes until it seems as if thats how it always has been.                            ";0
"As an 8th grader, I have often wondered about the benefits of attending school versus completing schoolwork at home. While some students may prefer the comfort of their own homes, others may thrive in a structured school environment. After conducting research and exploring different options available for students who cannot attend school, I have come to realize that both scenarios have their own advantages and disadvantages.

On one hand, attending school provides students with a social atmosphere that can enhance their learning experience. Being around peers and teachers can stimulate discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better understanding and retention of material. Additionally, schools often offer various extracurricular activities and clubs that can help students develop their interests and talents. For example, joining a sports team or music club can help students develop teamwork and leadership skills, respectively.

On the other hand, completing schoolwork at home can offer students more flexibility and autonomy in their learning. Students can work at their own pace and take breaks whenever they need to, which can be especially helpful for those who have different learning styles or have difficulty concentrating in a classroom setting. Moreover, students can access online resources and tools that can provide personalized learning experiences tailored to their needs.

For students who cannot attend school due to various reasons, such as illness or disability, there are different options available. Online schools and homeschooling programs can provide a structured learning environment that is tailored to the individual student's needs. These programs can offer flexibility and personalized attention that may not be possible in a traditional classroom setting.

However, there are also major differences between attending school and completing schoolwork at home. In a classroom setting, students can receive immediate feedback and support from teachers, which can help them stay on track with their education. Additionally, teachers can provide real-time feedback and guidance, which can help students improve their understanding and performance. In contrast, completing schoolwork at home can be more isolating, and students may struggle to stay motivated and focused without the structure and support of a classroom environment.

Despite these differences, there are ways that students can stay on track with their education if they are completing schoolwork at home. For example, setting a schedule and creating a conducive learning environment can help students stay organized and focused";1
"Driverless cars are the transportation system of the future. Their benefits greatly outweigh those of the current system. Driverless cars are easily possible to develop, much safer than regular cars, and have benefits for both people and the environment.

Driverless cars are already in development, and many manufacturers have already designed and created the technology which makes them possible. Driverless cars require sensors which allow them to mimic human reaction to whatever situation might arise while on the road. Sensor technology has been in development and in use since the 1980s, with the introduction of antilock brakes. Using this technology, Google modified a Toyota Prius with several sensors which allows the car to access a 3-D model of its environment. The proper technology to introduce driverless cars is clearly already available to manufacturers. In fact, in 2013, BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" which allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itself. The world is already well on its way to the creation of a truly driverless car.

Some might object to the safety of driverless cars, but in reality, driverless cars introduce more safety to the road environment. An operating system or machine cannot become tired, frustrated, emotional, angry, or distracted in any way; its judgement is mechanical, and there are no variables of human unpredictability. Most if not all vehicular accidents are caused by some sort of human error in judgement, and driverless cars eliminate this possibility, which is conducive to a much safer driving environment. A possible cosumer concern might be that with the current model of semi-driverless cars, which still require some human effort, people may get tired or distracted waiting for their turn to drive. However, manufacturers are developing an answer to this concern which introduces more safety than a regular driving environment would have. Some manufacturers are introducing in-car displays which turn off instantly when driver assistance is required, which is not possible with a regular cellphone or messaging device. This eliminates any in-car distraction during the driving task, With human error eliminated, driverless cars are much safer than regular ones.

Finally, the driverless car introduces benefits to both people and the environment. Driverless cars can allow people to safely engage in other activities besides driving, allowing them to achieve and accomplish more. Driving can be tiring, and driverless cars eliminate driving as a task for people to complete. Many factors can impair driving ability and prevent one from driving, but with driverless cars, mobility is always possible, and transportation is always accessible. A Google cofounder estimates that driverless cars can eventually eliminate the need for personal cars at all, by introducing a public transportation system of entirely driverless vehicles, and that these vehicles can use half the fuel of current taxis. This can have huge benefits for the environment.

Driverless cars are a much better alternative to the transportation systems of today. They can and are being devleoped, carry benefits to the environment and to people, and are much safer than regular cars.";0

"I think the facial action coding system enable computer is not good to be in the classroom because ... why would you have something in there that can be wrong i dony know why people aways think computers will always know it all because they dont.

People in this world always going off on what people say or showing them computers dont always be right , i would never go and get a computer to help me with my problems because they dont know everything plus why would you want it in the classroom anyway , someone can come steal it or anything you never now a days people is doing all types of stuff

But again i think it will be good for to be at school because when the students walks in the classroom they can just have them come to the computer and scan them to make sure they are having a good day and nothing is bothring them. Also they should check them when they come into the classroom because they probaly can be having a ruff day and just going to a hard time , but you can make them happy when they walk in the classroom ny, for example""

using the zygomatic major and different musle , the risorious "". But to be honest i really think its not a good idea because why you have a computer trying to sovle people problems when you can just have them talk to someone about it , it dont make sense to have extra stuff to help kids when its a soical worker there. They need to do something better with they money at the school instead of trying to by nonsense and bring it to the school. All tho they trying to help the children out and make them better or whatever they trying to do its not not worth paying alot of money for a mixed emotion computer when you can just send them to they soical worker .But the moral of the story is that no i would never but this comuputer its a good brand to the school and all but i would just not get one.

- but we all know i would never get one of these computers

-This is what i think of the Facial Action Coding System Computer

"While almost everyone owns and uses a mobile device, using them while behind the wheel of a vehicle should be prohibited.

While mobile devices are useful in everyday life, they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved. Devices cause distractions that can put not only the driver of the vehicle at risk but also those inside the vehicles, and the people all around the car. Distracted driving is one of the most dangerous types of driving and according to Edger Snyder & Associates, ""the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes every year"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates ""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving""). The sheer amount of crashes involving the use of mobile devices is shocking, and this is one of the main reasons that the use of any kind of device should be not allowed while behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Although a crash may not seem that bad, some of these crashes result in many deaths and injuries. In a 2018 study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it states that distracted driving claims over 2,841 lives (Andrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov 2020). These numbers represent not only the drivers, but also include their passengers and any pedestrians who have died as a result of the negligence and recklessness of drivers distracted by mobile devices. The dangers that distracted drivers place not only themselves but also those around them is completely unnecessary. The dangers not only lie on the road but they also extend to after the crash takes place.

One of the other major issues that distracted drivers face is the financial costs incurred after the initial wreck. The people that suffer the most financial damage are the drivers, followed by their passengers, and then pedestrians involved in the accident. Some reason drivers suffer the most is because they are left paying for the damages to the cars and for personal injuries, not to mention their insurance premiums potentially increase. The passengers and pedestrians suffer because of bodily injuries and potential long term recuperation. While they likely do not have to pay for vehicle damages, if severe enough, injuries prevent them from performing their day to day activities and work functions, which may leave them unable to work and without money to survive. The law office of Tavss Fletcher states that ""the average cost for each death in a motor vehicle accident is $1,130,000"" and ""each nonfatal disabling injury is $61,600"" (""The Price Paid for Automobile Accidents and Injuries""). So the cost for the accident far outweighs the risk of texting or calling while they are driving, not to mention the potential risk of injury not only for themself but for everyone involved in the accident.

On top of the financial and physical pain these types of accidents cause, there is also the emotional pain of the victims and the victim's families. When a victim survives and they are injured, they can't immediately go back to work, school, or their normal lives. They need to go to physical rehabilitation which causes strain on everyone involved. Along with this, there are mental disorders that develop after the crash, one of which is depression. According to the Myers Law Firm ""Some physical injuries limit victims' ability to work, exercise, and enjoy day-to-day activities like playing with their children. If you're suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it's no surprise you may become depressed"" (Myers Law Firm 2020). The victims may have difficulty adjusting to a new ""normal"" caused by injuries. These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities. Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish. Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult. Often time people involved in wrecks will have flashbacks about it, sometimes triggered by being in a car, being near the wreck site or something completely unrelated. Not only is the physical and financial cost of such an accident steep, but the mental toll has a hefty cost.

Aside from the mental, physical, and financial sides of the argument there is also the legal side of it. Many states are starting to realize the dangers of distracted driving and are prohibiting it, and if anyone is caught they will either be fined or sentenced to serve in jail for a short time. One example of a state that has made using a mobile device while behind the wheel of a vehicle is Georgia. The hands-free law states that ""A driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone...A driver may not write, send or read any text messages, e-mails, social media or internet data content""(""Hands-Free Law""). The states understand that the use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is dangerous, and they are starting to enforce that they need to get it under control.

The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited.

"Nowdays technology is almost the base for everything; for medicine, for entertaniment, for research and everyday technology is developing faster and faster.

Since technology has become something for must people, a very essensial tool in order to live, they have decide to create even more things from it to make their lives easier; which this leading them to depend on technology in aspects of their lives like work, doctor, school, amusement, etc.

But what would happen is technology shuts down one day or even a month? People who depend on technology will be forlorn.

In relation to the arcticle and the question about technology shuting down, if we use this technolgy called Facial Action Coding System in students to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom, we can have advantage when it comes to understanding and helping the students. But when it comes for technology shuting down then what? Teacher of superiors are not going to be able anymore to guide students by themselves. They would depend on the program to detect how can they act in order to help the classroom.

This program can be useful but in even more important aspects as reasearch is. For example, that they tell us about how miguel angel created Mona Lisa, with this program they could analyze Mona Lisa's expressions behind the painting.

We humnas are smart enough to read someone facial expressions and analyze them. The need to crate a program and to waste money that can be used in more important investigations, is not really something required for society in order to develop.

Maybe detecting people's emotions can help the government or they would be the only ones to get a benefit from it, so they can control easily the citizens.

Overall, the creation of technologic programs like this is really not helping schools but research, and the less we depend on technology in order to survive, everyone would be more conected to earth and would use more the riches a country has, rather than creating more tech grabage.";0
"Have you ever thought about what the world would do without cars? and we just used bikes or trains or skate boards or even buses? well in Bogota they have a day where you dont use your car and millions just biked or skated and took buses to work or school on the car free day. Its the third year cars have been banded in Bogota and the goal is to reduce smog. The people who didnt perticipate in this were charged with twenty five dollar fines.

Bogota isnt the only place that banded cars. paris actually banded driving due to smog. In paris the people were to leave their cars at home or they would have to pay a 22-euro fine which means thirty one dollars. You would think people would listen to them, but four thousand people decided to drive so they were all charged. All though this seems good becuase there would be no air pollution it wasnt so good for delivery componies because they complained about lost revenue.

Also in Germany they permitly banned cars. seventy percent of the familys do not own cars. But fifty seven percent sold a car just to move there. People say they are much happier this way like a Heidrun, a mother of two "" when i had a car i was tense. im much happier this way"" as she walked the streets. David Goldburg said "" All of our developements since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" he is an offical of the transportation for america, its a fast growing coalisition with hundrends of groups in the US. They are promoting new commuties that are less dependent on cars.

I feel that if the United States start doing this then the whole world might start. It would make the world a better place. There would be less air pollution or ""smog"" and you wouldnt have to pay fro gas anymore. Its also a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. If you need to go somewhere just ride you bike or if its far take a bus, its as simple as that. There would be less taxes and you wouldnt have to pay anymore car payments. "" recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses asa each year goes by"" most people dont drive becuase they either cant afford a car or they dont have a job.

In the end this may actually start happening. Bill Ford which is th eexecutive chairman of the Ford Motor Company was talking about a business plan in which vehicle ownership is impractical. he said that cities that ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network top save time, and improve safety."" and he is completley right there will be no more car crashes or drunk drivers anymore, the world may become a better place.

"Dear Mrs.

,

I think that you should go with the first policy. The first policy could work very easily and a lot more students would like it. You should consider maybe having a recording sheet of students that have been caught for using their phones in classes and have teachers check to see if students phones are off. Another compromise is every teacher could have a basket that students put their phones into at the beginning of a class.

The second policy is taking the fact that you don't want students using their phones in class too far. Not letting a student have their phone at school is extremely unfair, a student might have to call a parent or a parent might have to call a student. either way not letting students have cellular devices is not fair and is outrageous.

You also have to think about the students who don't have cell phones. Both of the policy's would not effect them at all. but what about all the kids who always turn their phone off before class? the second policy would be extremely unfair to them. they always follow the rules and do what they are supposed to do, and now even thou they have always follow the rules you are still deciding over if you should let students use their phones.

I do not agree at all with the idea of you choosing what we should do. The students are the people looking for an education and i think that we should have a school vote on which policy we should follow. Put yourself in our shoes and see how it would be. You always follow the rules and you always do the right thing but when something like this comes up you get the third degree. You are letting a few students ruin something that is precious to almost all. I very much think that you should read and reread my letter ma'am and i letter that you will make the right decision.

Thank you for reading

Sincerely,

"Cars may have some advantages, but the world, would be a better place if we limited car useage. The benifits of limiting our usage of cars is, it will help improve the enviornment, there are healthy alternitves, and not useing cars as much will decrease stress that people have.

Decreasing our car usage will emprove the environment. In the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""  In France they banned even numbered liscence plates from driving, for one day, and one day was all it took for the high levels of smog to decrease. In another Artical ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal it talks about the decrease usage of cars throught the years, paragraph 34 says "" If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" If the people keep slowing down on using cars, which scientist believe it will, there will be better carbon e,issions in the air, and the air will be better. Limiting car usage will help make our environment better.

Walking, biking, and skateing are all excercises that help you stay fit, but they are also a healthy alternative to cars. A artical published in the

Seattle Times called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky describes the day that is trending all over the world, the day cars are banned. People in these countries, in this case Colombia ""hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work"" Banning car usage enchourages people to get up and walk, run, or bike because they can't use their car. In the town Vauban, Germany a car free town, people walk everywhere, because the town has no cars. In the town ""...where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" The people in this town are walking and staying fit everyday.

One last benifit of limited car usage is it causes people less stress. Heidrun Walter , a mother of two who lives in Vauban, Germany, says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now."" Once Walter sold her car she was relived, she didn't have to worry about making her next car payment, when she would have to get gas again, or how much money gas was. Getting rid of her car relived her stress. Not using cars will decrease the amount of stress in society.

Over all, limiting are car usage would greatly benifit us, it will help keep the environment clean, keep our people healthy, and it will cause people less stress.                     ";0
"The arts of technology. I think it is safe to say that technology has expanded over time. We live in a world where kids and even adults have technology. It is a part of our socitey now, but remember how hundreds of years ago we did not have technolgy and we did just fine? How we showed emotions throught our and nothing else and now days we have emoticans and what not?

Now we have a computer that reads us. How weird is that? We did not need this but now we seem to have. Kids now days email their teacher in order to get help when not so long ago we had Saturday school to tutor those that needed help. This computer is going to help teacher supposedly read tyhe face expression children make has they are exlaining the lesson. That way they can go back and see who makes expression of confusion and does not.

This will help those kids that are to afraid to say thye need help. See a childs ego can be pretty big when it comes to their education believe it or not. A kid could be too afraid to ask for help because they have a feeling they can do it on their own. The computer target each motion the face makes or when ever a muscle is different or changes in a face. A teacher/studenet relationship is now going to followed up by a computer screen. Won't be long untill the robots take over.

This computer program will probably make it easy for other people to see how they feel towards one another. Maybe some will like the answer and other will not. See thing about this is that maybe the computer will ditect a feeling that the person will not be sharing at all or does not want people to know about this feeling. It could be invady some privacy because this person mught be hdidng a feeling thay do not want show, This computer will read that due to the face muscles he/she will be moving. Whoever reads the results of this person will find themselve in a position they will not knnow what to do.

Maybe this computer program is good for somethings, but in some ocasions it will not be a good source. Also this computer program alterates more the usage of technolgy these days. This will make society more intense and more into technology then what it already is. People should be able to show and tell their emotions if they feel free to. Not by a computer to tell them for them!";0
"Student's usual school day lasts about 6-8 hours. After school, students usually like to kick back and relax. Some student's might actually have things to do after-school, like sports or schoolwork. However, if they're principal takes that privilege away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.

Students also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.

Being required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work. Late assignments will increase, which will bring down student's grades very quickly. More missing work will increase, too, which will bring their grade down even more. Adding more after-school activities, whether it's academic or not, will cause students unnecessary stress.

So whats the issue? After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.";0
"For the past few hundred years, school systems have consisted of one specific format, where students go to a place of learning and are taught by teachers. But now, with easier access to better technology, this school system is changing. Some schools are offering distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This new system has gained both positive and negative attention. Although many say that distance learning encourages laziness and creates a communication barrier between students and others, distance learning is in fact beneficial to the student, for learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process.

However, many argue that the student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, for distance learning would encourage laziness and create a communication barrier between students and others. Understandably, these points are legitimate, for the student could easily choose not to join the online conference to their class, for no teacher could force them to go to their next class. But this is just the same concept as skipping class. A student has their own free will, and may choose whether they go to their class or not, or whether they attend their video conference to their class as well. Laziness is not encouraged by distance learning, but instead students have the choice to either attend their video conference or not, just as they have the choice to attend their class at a normal school as well: there is no major difference between these methods of skipping class. Many also point to a communication barrier between the students and their peers and teacher. However, the technology today of online and video conferences, such as Skype, can offer both auditory and visual interaction between the student and others. It's exactly like a classroom setting, with the only difference being that the student isn't physically there. In the future, with even more and more technological advances, these virtual interactions will become even more effective. Distance learning would also help to block out the other distractions that come with school.

Distance learning would help get rid of the other distractions that come with going to school, such as a student's social life. The main purpose of school has always been one goal: to educate the student and teach them how to learn. But inside schools many distractions are present. The social life of a student, whether that be talking to another student during class, or interactions in the hallway, has become a huge distraction to learning. However, with distance learning, these distractions would be eliminated. Of course, at-home learning will open up the possibility of home distractions, but the number of distractions will certainly be less than the number of distractions at school. With this removal of distractions, a new focus on learning is produced, one that is much more stress-free.

A more stress-free learning experience, due to the removal of school-related distractions, would make the process of learning much more effective for the student, fulfilling the main goal of schools: to educate the student and teach them how to learn. Stress due to school has become a major problem in our school systems. Students staying up until the early hours of the morning to do homework is an example. However, what students don't know, is that if the distractions of school are eliminated, by learning at home through online or video conference, they would be much more focused and would feel comparably less stressed as they go about their schoolwork. Being less stressed would make learning a more enjoyable, fulfilling experience, and would be much more effective for the student.

Learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process. With the process of learning becoming more effective, students would be able to learn at unprecedented rates and would be ready to tackle the problems of our world. Because isn't that the whole point of education, and more specifically school? To educate the student and teach them how to learn, so that one day, when the students are making decisions that will not only impact themselves but the whole world, they will be ready and willing to take on these challenges.";0
"Luke participated in the 'Seagoing Cowboys program' because he wanted to help the other people that had to suffer from 'World War ll'. He also wanted to participate because it sounded fun and he would get to see different countrys. I know this because the article states, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" The aritcle also states, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.""

Luke also participated in the 'Seagoing Cowboys program' because he got to help people and animals. He also participated because he got to participate with his friend. I know this because the article states, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more."" The article also states, ""Luke and Don signed up.""

Luke participated in 'Seagoing Cowboys because he was given the change to go Europe on a cattle-boat with his friend Don. Luke also participated in 'Seagoing Cowboys program' because when he was given the change to go to Europe he could not say no to his friend. I know this because the article states, ""Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle-boat."" The article also states, ""Luke could not say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.""

He also participated because he wanted to have fun and meat new people. He also participated because he wanted adventure. I know this because the srticle states, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games."" The article also states, ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opend up the world to him.""

I think Luke participated because he just wanted to help pther people. I also think that Luke participated because he wanted to have fun and explore. I know this because the article states, ""44 nations joined together to form UNRRA."" The article also states, ""It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity , "" he says.""";0
"The article "" A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" is about a boy named Luke Bomberger. His friend Don Reist invited him to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew it was an opportunity of a life time. To help these countries recover their food suplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.)

In 1945 the UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On

August 14 1945 Luke and Dom headed for greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus. In 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The Cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

I think that being a "" Seagoing Cowboy"" will be fun and adventurest. As you travel on the cattle boat you will be able to visit unique and amazing places. You will also have fun while you are doing it. You will also be able to experence lots of thing that most others can not. As your doing these fun and exsiting stuff you will also be helping those recovering countries in need of help with food suplies, animals, and more.

So in my point of view and Luke's is to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If i were you i would definatly help thhose in need of foos suplies and animals. If you like/love animals and helping others in need this will be a perfect job for you.";0
"Working in groups in the classroom has numerous benefits compared to working alone. In this essay, I will discuss three of the most important advantages of group work, and provide evidence to support my position.

Firstly, working in groups allows for collaboration and the exchange of ideas. When students work together, they can share their knowledge and perspectives with one another, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. This is particularly beneficial in subjects such as science and math, where problem-solving requires a diverse range of skills and perspectives. For example, when working on a science project, a group of students with different areas of expertise can pool their knowledge to create a more successful outcome.

Secondly, group work encourages communication and social skills. When students work together, they must communicate effectively with one another in order to achieve their goals. This can help students develop important social skills, such as active listening, assertiveness, and empathy. Group work also provides an opportunity for students to learn from their peers and develop their own communication styles. For example, when working on a group presentation, students can learn how to give and receive feedback in a constructive manner.

Finally, group work can help students develop leadership and problem-solving skills. When students work in groups, they must take on different roles and responsibilities, such as group leader, note-taker, and problem solver. This can help students develop important leadership and problem-solving skills, which are essential for success in both academic and professional settings. For example, when working on a group project, students can learn how to delegate tasks and manage group dynamics in order to achieve their goals.

In conclusion, working in groups in the classroom has numerous benefits compared to working alone. Collaboration, communication, and leadership skills are just a few of the important advantages of group work. By providing opportunities for students to work in groups, educators can help their students develop important skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.";1
"Started with the founding fathers. The Electoral College was founded and swung into the constitution, as a compromise between Congress and the President with a popular and electoral vote. Now that time has evolved and the world has changed. The Electoral College is not in the favor of everyones expectations, it seems like it favors one side more than it favors others. The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe.

Intially, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing presidents. The Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, ""Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" The candidates in the ""lame"" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are ""the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election."" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized.

Also, the Electoral College can be known as a non-democratic method. When something is non-democratic, it means that it is not in the democrats favor. It is a rap for them, its already set for the Republicans to win. Stated in the passage, ""In a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" Democrats may cast in their vote for presidential candiate comes with a group of electors, they see the electoral college as favorable towards the Republican group.

Next, the Electoral College should be changed, because it causes catastrophe. When voting for president, it puts the electors in charge. ""Electors can be anyone not holding public office."" One may never know how much the elector is trustworthy, and responsible. Some may not even feel comfortable with leaving the electors in charge of such cases. People feel uneasy, because they do not know what happens behind close doors, they are never certain on who's hands can change things for the benefit of themselves. The citizens and the people may not be comforatbe with such things.

But, as much as the Electoral College may not seem beneficial and fair to some it can be a good thing also. Stated in the passage ""Election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where delegations vote on the president."" Us people, us as citizens would not even be in charge or have a say so in who runs our country. We would not even have a choice or chance to vote and see who is worthy and most honorable in our eyes to be our president. Some may be lucky on the Representative choices on who the Electors and our Presidents would be, but also some may be dissatisified. The favor will only be in the representaives place. And the odds will be onto us. The Electoral College is not ran by the Representatives. We have a say so.

Finally, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe. The Electoral College shows a wide range of it either being a good or a bad way on voting.                ";0
"How do you feel about driverless cars? Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, is working on a profect called ""The Google Car Project"". I personally think that with google cars a lot can go wrong. I believe that becuase it is easier to have car accidents, easy for the equipment to malfunction, and who would you sue if you were wrecked by a Google Car?

First, with Google Cars people aren't controlling what is happening. Although there usually is a person in the car of a smart driving car, a lot of the time that driver is probably not paying attention to the road. Most smart driving cars have built in techneques that make it so that the person in the car has to at least have their hands on the wheel. For example, ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car can handle driving functions at speeds of up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.""

Second, with Google Cars it would be easier for a wreck if the car malfuntioned. It would be easier for the car to malfuntion becuase, for example, say you were in a Google Car and you got a warning that your break fluid was low, you wouldn't know becuase you weren't paying attention to your car. Also, they have made a sensor that goes on the roof of your car so that the car can see all around your car. If that sensor malfuntions, the car wouldn't be able to see where it was going and you could wreck. For example, ""The most important bit of technolofy in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.""

Lastly, who would you sue if you were in a wreck and you or the car that hit you was a smart car? Would you sue the person driving, or the car manufacturer? Or say you were driving a smart car and you broke the law, drivers fault or manufacturer? These are very important questions. For example, ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?

How do you feel about driverless cars? Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, is workng on a project called ""The Google Car Project"". I personally think that with Google Cars a lot can go wrong. I believe that because it's easier to have car accidents, easy for the equipment to malfuntion, and who would you sue if you were wrecked by a Google Car?";0
"Who should I go to for advice? My parents? My teacher? My friends? When asking anyone for advice, seek more than person because people have different viewpoints, talking to more than one person will help you alter your decisions, and talking to someone older can give great life advice.

When asking people for advice, seek more than one person because people have different viewpoints. In life choices, sometimes there is two or more sides of an argument. Seeking help from people can help you think which side of the argument is right. People have different reasons to choose the choices they've made. They would think, how would this effect them or what it would do to others. If it's better off for them and other people, then it's a safer choice. Talking to more than one person can point out which advice is better, which one to use, and how it could be done. Choosing between people's advice can help someone make a better decision. Thinking and choosing between viewpoints can help someone make a better decision as a person.

When asking for advice, seek more than one person for help because talking to more than one person will help alter your decisions. For example, once I searched for advice on how to work out my plan for the school year, for having a lot of after-school activities to fill up my time, I needed to figure out how to fit my homework and free time into my day. So, I seeked my dad first for help. He told that, whatever works for me, as long as I get everything I need done in that day, completed. So, I don't have to worry if my grades fall and I get my work done when it's supposed to be turned in. My dad gave me really good advice but I asked my mom too so I would get mostly the same idea. She told me that, I should get all my work I need done, completed. So I could do whatever I wanted later and as long as I don't get under a C-. I'm fine and I don't need someone to help me if I understand the work we're doing. Both of my parent had good and near the same advice. So, I put together in my head, the plan I have now. My plan for the school year is a big part of my weekdays. It's useful that I got the help from my parents to form and use it today.

When it comes to asking people for advice, It's helpful to ask more than one person because talking to someone older can give great life advice. People that are older give lots of advice like how to meet new people, how to know wrong from right, how to find a job, and so much more. They can tell you if they've made bad decisions so you don't make those bad decisions. Older people can help you with life decisions like what kind of car is the safest, what neighborhoods are protected, and again so much more. Older people know what are the best decisions that they can give you and it can benefit your life a lot. When it comes to something bad, older people in your life can prevent you from making those decisions by opening up to what's wrong and what's right. Seeking help from people older than yourself can give amazing life advice to benefit your future.

When asking people for advice, seek more than one person because people have different viewpoints, talking to more than one person will help alter your decisions, and talking to someone older can give great life advice. Life choices can have am argument between choices that are different from each other. It can be hard to point out which side of an argument is right because people have different reasons to make the choice that they did. Talking to more than one person can point out which advice is better and which one to choose. In my story, I explained that talking to more than one person can help you alter decisions and it also is possible to form an agreement between two different viewpoints. But, if you have two viewpoints that already agree with each other, that doesn't need to be done. Older people can give great advice when it comes to helping with life decisions and preventing you from making bad ones. These people's advice can benefit you a lot and you should take it when they give it. Seeking advice can help with anything you're going through or feeling, even if it's just minor.";0
"As people, we all understand the importance of making a good first impression. This is especially true in professional and dating situations, where we want to put our best foot forward and ensure a pleasant and successful exchange. However, some people might argue that first impressions are “almost impossible” to change. I disagree with this statement, as I believe that first impressions can be changed and improved through thoughtful consideration and action.

Although making that initial strong impression typically takes less than a few seconds, it is a moment that can influence the present and future relationship. With that said, I believe that first impressions can be purposefully shifted with a strong intention and dedicated effort. For example, if I make a mistake during a job interview, I can take the time to apologize, explain the situation in appropriate and honest detail, and move on, showing how I have learned and grown from the experience. Similarly, if I have a heated argument early in a relationship, I can work respectfully and compassionately to bridge the gap with the other person.

Therefore, first impressions can be improved, but the degree of difficulty will depend on both the mistake and the situation. We must all consider our first impressions carefully, recognizing that they can be powerful but not binding. Through communication, respect, and effort, I believe that the negative assumptions associated with a first impression can be managed and, ultimately, overcome.";1
"I think  free car cities would have ups and downs. its downs would be not having quick transportation and waiting for public transportation. its ups would be saving money on gas andglobal warming would start to decrease. if this does happen i would like it very much.

In todays world car companys are starting to build eletric cars to eventually to stop making cars that run on gas to be eco friendly. also not having  cars would not be to intellgent because how would over 5,000 to 7,000 people get to work everyday by bus or taxi or train it would be a nightmare. After all that they all have to take the same bus home. It would be absoulte caios in the city nobody would no what to do with out cars.

The good part of not have cars is that people would get tko save money becuase there not speanding it on gas. Also the the traffic would go down beause theres no cars on the road. Personally i dont think car free citites would work like people think it would everybody woul have to ride in public transportation and that would be like a war because everybody would be fighting for seats. it might work for the first two weeks but after that it would be awful.

The bad part about have no ars is finding ways to get from point A to point B because everybody would be using transportation and the other half of people would be walking. so the buses would be crowded and the sidewalks would be very busy.  I think cars should be in all cities, but there cars should be eletric not running on gas. after that the car companys should make eletric buses so everything would be eco friendly.

Finally after my opinion on car free cities i came to conclusion that i didnt agree with this topic beacuse with out cars people would be crowding the streets and it would be hard to get round by walking becuase the streets would be packed. Since my opinon is strong my argument would win and pople would agree that car free cities would not work like people think it would.    ";0
"Wouldn't it be awesome to always have something to do at the end of a long boring school day. Extracurricular activities give you that chance. I believe that everyone should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity every school year. I think this because of all the benefits. Also, every extracurricular activity has a different advantage. The extracurricular activities I think everyone should be a part of are: sports, academic, and different clubs.

The first, and my personal favorite, extracurricular activity is sports teams. Sports teams create a way for kids to get exercise. Kids are recommended to exercise 60 minutes each day. Joining a sports team ensures that you reach that goal. Not only would it be healthy, but the student would feel good about him/herself. Teamwork is also and benefit to joining a sports team. Teamwork is one of the most important skills. It's one of the the only skills people absolutely need to be successful in life. Sports teams are one of the best ways to practice and get better at that skill. Another skill acquired in sports teams is leadership. In sports teams leadership is always a reoccurring skill. You also need to show leadership throughout you life, similar to teamwork. Some may be a bit shy and not necessarily know how to correctly take a lead in situations, but sports teams could definitely fix that. To think this is only one of the types of extracurricular activities to choose from, doesn't it already seem worth your time?

The next option for an extracurricular activity is the academic workshops you're able to join. Academic workshops and clubs can push students to do better. In these academic workshops you surround yourself with people who want to be better, and are better than you. Surrounding yourself with people who are better than you encourages you to do better for yourself and pride. Academic workshops may also improve your grades a little or a lot depending on how dedicated you are to do so. There are workshops like homework club that help students who need a little more help and guidance than others. If these particular students participate in these types of things, they're sure to see and improvement anytime soon.

Lastly, there are so many different types of clubs any student could be a part of and interested in. Everybody should try something new every once in a while. The different clubs that schools have are the perfect opportunity. I'm going to introduce you to two of the clubs that sparked my interest. First is the yearbook club. Doesn't it just sound fun by its name? Wouldn't you want to be a part of the book that everyone raves about at the end of the year? You get to take pictures, make fun subtitles/caption, and so much more. Sometimes you even get extra credit for it. Seems like a deal breaker to me. Then there's student council. This is probably my favorite clubs to be a part of. It's very intriguing to see what it's like to be somewhat of a politician. Student council is also an awesome opportunity to show your teamwork and leadership skills strengthened by sports teams. Besides, wouldn't it be fun to basically be at the head of the school. Think about it, these are just two of the hundreds of clubs you're able to choose from.

I believe every student should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity. Sports teams help push exercise, and strengthen teamwork and leadership. Academic workshops encourage better grades and motivates students to do better. There are also opportunities for student to try new things with the different types of clubs. Think of how well rounded a student would be by participating in one of these extracurricular activities every school year. ";0
"the use technology more useful to read the emotional expressions of the students is valuable is because teaches the students spmething that they never known.

the articles making mona lisa smile is a claim is because the using of technology to read students emotional expressions makes them think about how can technology so our emotional expressions and the only way to do that is by seeing a friends feeling and by seeing the facial muscles move and precisley enough to show it .

foor computers to show emotions it has to see the 44 major muscles model and how they move when they react to the emotions if the major muscles model don't move in the computer then we won't be able see the emotions .

the ways you can sse if youre showing a emotion is going to a mirror and see waht is happening to show emotion iis raie your lips at the corners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corner of yours eyes, whild holding that raise the outer parts of the cheeks up toward your eyes. and thats what can to do to show emotions.

In conclusion, technology that is called FACS can show huaman emotions byy showing what creates them by show the mona lisa painting and what caused her to smile and this considers this valuable to the student so they can learn about this.     ";0
"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home.

Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up.

Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate.

The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer.

Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home.        ";0
"Dear: principal

I think students should be required to take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service because they can learn more better education by just being apart of something achieving in life as in doing their school work, getting good grades, being dedicated and representable to the respect in the school policy. and other ways representable student could be held as loyal and helpful students in our school areas. and i also think students should really take a thoughtful moment about rather the community service activity should or would waste their quality time at home just wasting a lot of time ands not really learning about anything important. and i think that it is right to establish that all kids should be required in cleaning up all of the junk that has been abandoned our important community. and i also believe that students should do the right thing and pick up of what they have done as in throwing trash on the ground and thinking it is cool, i don't believe deep down inside that kids and adults should trash and liter up our community like this. and i truly possibly think that kids should think about keeping our environment clean and be supportive.

"This is a completely wrong, and unjust demandment that's given to the students. Students have their own lives to deal with, and some of them have it more difficult than others. It's not fair how schools are forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities, when they don't know what's going on in a students life. These students should have a choice, of whether, or not they want to participate in these activities.

Students already have enough stress as it is, whether it's from school, home, or maybe even their job that they need to support their families. Some students have to take care of sick family members, or they're dealing with their own personal problems, and therefore cannot participate. Schools can not make it a ""must"" for everyone because some families do not want their child to participate in extracurricular activities.

Students may want to participate but can't because of their own personal reasons, and that can lower their self esteem. As schools give out more than needed homework to students, them must having to participate could effect their grades. It would also effect their mental, and physical health to be forced to participate in these extracurricular activities.

Schools don't know what's going on in a students life, therefore it's not fair that they are forcing them to participate in extracurricular activities. Schools need to give the students the freedom to choose what they wish to do with their free time, and not force them to. In conclusion this rule is very wrong, unjust and should not exist.";0
"In modern society, cars are obviously popular. They are one of the most used means of transportation, and driving can be exciting for some people. Now because cars are so popular today, many wrecks occur consistently. Rather it be because of the person who was driving the car's fault, or another car accidently or purposely hitting the other car, this is why I am against driveless cars. So many wrecks happen already with an actual person driving the vehicle, imagine no one driving the car. The level of safety would not be exceeded, and would rise the statistics of deaths in cars.

First, an issue with driveless cars is not only do we need the technology to make the car driveless, we also have to change our surroundings. ""Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" The passage explains that some roads will need to be changed for driveless cars to work effectively. These ""smarter roads"" would need electricle cables to send signals to the car, magnets for alternating polarity and binary codes. Now no one is saying this can not be done because it has been accomplished before, but there will be an expensive price that comes with it. If these prices are not dealt with, no smarter roads and definitley no smarter cars.

Although today, driveless cars technically exist, they are not 100% reliable. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This places a lot of responsibility for the driver and those seated in the car. Due to the car not being completely driveless, one will have to pay attention to the road, accidents, and where they are heading. If the driver located in the car is not paying attention this can cause car wrecks and even death. To add more safety to the car, the manufactures have created signals. The signals let the driver know when there is danger ahead. But if the driver misses these signals, they are again at risk and their safety becomes their responsibility.

Another problem that arises with driveless cars is the relatonship between the manufacturers and the driver or those in the car. Accidents happen often, and if an accident were to happen it is hard to choose who would be at fault. Would it be the manufacturer who is supposed to create their inventions to perfection for an individuals safety? Or would it be the drivers fault because if something were to happen, they should be aware at all times? ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" It is very difficult to answer these questions, therefore safety regulations have been admitted in certain states including California, Nevada, Florida and the District of Columbia.

In conclusion, driveless cars have a long way to go before they can be considered safe. Deaths are skyrocketing as it is with humans driving cars and we certainly are not ready for a car to drive itself. Until we have the proper technology that will work at all costs, driveless cars are useless and better left untouched.         ";0
"Okay, here's my essay:

Everyone has different personalities. Like, some people are really outgoing and talkative, and some people are more quiet and reserved. Some people are really competitive and like to win, and some people are more laid back and just want to have fun. It's like, everyone's got their own unique personality, and that's what makes the world interesting.

But sometimes, people can have a bad day. Like, maybe they had a fight with their best friend or they didn't do well on a test. And sometimes, people can be really grumpy or irritable because of it. It's like, they're just having a bad day, and they can't help it.

But here's the thing: people can change their first impressions. Like, if someone is being really grumpy or mean, you can try to be nice to them and make them feel better. Or, if someone is being really quiet and reserved, you can try to get to know them better and find out what's going on. It's like, people are more than just their first impressions, and you can help them change their mood or behavior.

For example, once in my class, there was this one kid who was always being really mean to everyone. He would make fun of people's clothes or their hair, and it was really hurtful. But then, one day, he had a bad day at home and he came to school looking really sad and lonely. So, I went up to him and asked him if he was okay, and he started crying. And after that, he wasn't mean to anyone anymore. It was like, he changed his first impression of himself, and he became a nicer person.

So, in conclusion, everyone has different personalities, and people can have bad days. But, people can also change their first impressions by being nice to them or getting to know them better. It's like, everyone has the power to change how they want to be perceived, and that's pretty cool.";1
"Although we shouldn't be using our phones but we can't stop because we are addicted to our phones. I do think they should have it to where it is hand free. I think drivers should not be able to use phones . I think they should not have phones because it's not safe and can cause a lot of injures. I also think they should not have phones because it makes the driver side tracked. I also think it should be a certain thing they could use instead of the phones. I think they should not be on phones also because it can distract another driver. I think people should not have phones.

I think they should not be abandoned from using their phones while in the car. I don't like the fact that they be having it set up to where it locks in the car. I don't like the fact that they be having it to where it wont let you press nothing or hook up bluetooth while the car is in motion. I think they should have phones also because they might need there phone to bluetooth and might want to use there phone to text someone to let them know how far they are or where to go.

I think we should be able to have phones in the car. We need our phones to use the gps, listen to music, and asses things. I think we should be able to have phones but they make it to where we don't use our hands we just use a a car bluetooth. I also think that we should have car automatics.

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is essential to agree with other people and take their opinions into consideration in order to grow and understand ideas. Ralph Waldo Emerson, a famous American essayist and philosopher, once said, ""The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."" This statement highlights the importance of agreement in bringing people's experiences together and allowing them to come to a mutual understanding.

When people agree with one another, they are able to share their experiences and ideas, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the world around them. By taking other people's opinions into consideration, we can learn from their experiences and gain new insights into different perspectives. This can help us to grow as individuals and expand our knowledge and understanding of the world.

Emerson believed that agreement was necessary for people to come to a mutual understanding and to work together towards a common goal. He argued that when people agree with one another, they are able to work together more effectively and achieve greater success. This is because when people have a shared vision and understanding of the world, they are able to work together towards a common goal with greater efficiency and effectiveness.

In conclusion, I believe that it is essential to agree with other people and take their opinions into consideration in order to grow and understand ideas. By doing so, we can learn from their experiences and gain new insights into different perspectives. This can help us to grow as individuals and expand our knowledge and understanding of the world.

"The Electoral college process consists of the selections of our electors. The electors get together and vote for presidents, and vice presidents. I think that the poeple of the united states should have all the power with voting. We should be able to vote for the electors. This would get rid of all the people that ruin our country or are corrupt. The voting system should have 2 finalists for each branch of the gorverment. They should add up all the vote and see who has the most. they're should not be two parties. I feel like this would make the voting more equal and fair. The candidate's running for president should not have they're own group of electors. They should speak the truth on how they will help this counrty out, and should trust that the people make the right vote.

The electoral college is looked at as a non-democratic way of selecting the president . When you vote, you're not voting for the presdient, you're voting for electors that will choose who is president. This means the people don't really have a say in the electoral college voting system

In my opinion, i think people should have all the power in voting, this would make the process alot smoother. The people would elect who they feel would do best for this counrty. This would also create new community groups and councils for voting. People would open up voting centers and meetings. It would employ more jobs and build a stronger relationship.

"Phones & Driving

In today's day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of different drivers with different experiences and different skills behind the wheel. Many people take pride in their ability to multitask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing traffic with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back. But a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distraction since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them. This is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in America with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly. Reasons like this is why most cars don't have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distraction to the driver. Driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, and Illinois with a fine of $50,00 and up to 1 year in prison. The main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

The first reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash. It's been documented that 19% of drivers of all ages admit to surfing the web while driving. In a blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it states,""This one is pretty obvious, but did you know that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive? According to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year. If you don't want to crash your car and get injured or even killed, don't text and drive."" These statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldn't overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesn't get published enough. Most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have grown up with older figures who do the same. A good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that states,""Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers."" This article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think it's okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though it's never safe. It also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and don't know how to multitask. A car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining PTSD from the experience. With that being said using your phone while multitasking in the car could result in a car crash.

The second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Many people use their phones while driving when they're with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,""Not only does texting and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap."" This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people's wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you're willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that says,""Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks."" This article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someone's mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers. Putting their friends at risk and potentially harming them is something that nobody wants to do. Which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving.

In conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and drive around clueless then everyone else suffers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to still put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences getting caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all multitasking while driving by using your phone only shows impatience and immaturity. Texting and driving has cause six times more deaths than drunk driving yet people still shrug it off due to them thinking they can manage to keep their attention in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their time on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a notification immediately and wait and do it when the time is right.            ";0
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that exploring and studying Venus must be done despite the dangers. They support this idea by stating how similar Venus is to Earth and that Venus could have been like Earth many years ago. They don't ignore the dangers though.

The author makes a point to mention the dangers of conducting research on Venus with statements like ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,"" and ""highly corrosive sulfuric acide in Venus's atmosphere."" They still combat this with reasons to continue though with statements about how similar it is to Earth, and that it ""could have supported various forms of life"".

Venus could have supported life forms and we might be able to research them if we were able to get to them. The author brings up computers that are entirely mechanical. these computers could be build to withstand the intense conditions of Venus. It is possable for us to research Venus further but how many lives is that worth? Our Author did a great job at informing us, but they didn't give us enough reason to make it worth the risk to research Venus.";0
"I think that students should be able to learn anyway they choose from home or at school or on a video. Some students learning from online could help like it could stop bullying from happening in school, but on the other hand the students may cheat without teachers even knowing. The student could also keep learning if they are not able to come to school because of sickness, they could still learn from home. It could also affect their learning style what if the class had to go into groups but the kids that are not actually not there cant be physical with the group. It could help some students learning online, some kids might learn better by learning if they are not at school.

If the kids do not attend in real life at the school it might affect they`re personal life like getting along with other students. It might be harder to learn from online than being actually at the school. What if the student has to go to the bathroom and misses something important, and they dont learn about what the teacher said and miss an important question on a test. I think it could help a lot of students to learn from home because they can focus more properly than in school. If the student has to learn from online during school what if they have like gym class they cant be active during that class then they have to do more paperwork instead of having fun.

Some classes the school offers online but what if the students want to take a class they really want but cant do it online. What if the students want to take engineering they cant do that online they should phsycally be there. What if the students wants to take a STEM class not all of those classes can be done online. If the school allows the students to take online classes from a video it should be ones they want to take, the students taking the classes from an online video arent very physical with the other students they can still talk and laugh but whats the fun if youre really not there. Some kids cant actually be at the school so the school offers them to take the classes online. My opinion is that it could help some students but it doesnt help all students it could also be a waste of money.

The school can offer alot of helpful classes from students not being there but i think the students learn more from being at school. Here are some examples of things that can happen if the students attend the class online from home, They might learn as much as the other students, what if the students work better with other people than not around other students. Some students might have to learn from home if they have cant be around other students like if they are sick or has problems with other students. I just think the kids have a better learning expeirence from being at the school in person. Some students might benefit from being at home learning online than in peerson.

If the students are able to to attend school from home i think it would make them more comfortable than being in school. Some teachers might want their students to learn from online or at the school. In some places students have to learn from home because of the cornonavirus and the teachers have to be at the school teaching. Some parents might not want their kids to go to school so they just let their kids attend school from online, beacuse the parents might think its best for the kids to stay at home and learn. The school might make the parents pay for the students to learn from home to be online but the school might let the students learn from online for free.";0
"Summer is a time for students to have fun and be able to relax without worrying about school work. However, some schools assign summer projects over the students break to make sure students are still learning throughout the year. A common question about these projects is who designes them. Should the teachers design them so that is stays on topic to what they need to learn, or should the Students themselves design the projects so that the projects are subjects that students are interested in. Student projects over summer break should be student designed because it gives students more freedom, allows students to do them in areas they have interests in, and allows students to create a type of project they are good at.

A common arguement against student designed projects is that the student will not stay on topic and will go to far off topic. Meanwhile if a teacher were to assign a project they would make sure that the student did not go off topic and it would be relative to the subject. However, a student designed project has much more benefits than a teacher designed project. It also will give teachers more time to get ready for the next school year if they do not need to design all the students projects. Even though teacher designed projects would be more on topic than a student designed project, Student designed projects pros outweigh the cons and therefore students summer projects should be designed by students.

Student designed projects allow students to give themselves more freedom over the summer by being able to design your own projects. Students most likely do not like projects over the summer in the first place, but if the students design their own projects, they are able to choose to do the project how they would like to do it. If they were teacher designed projects then the students would not want to do them because they had no choice in picking what they were doing and will most likely not do it. Students want freedom, they dont want to be told what to do, if a schools were to give them teacher designed projects then students would not be as motivated to complete them as much as a student designed project. If it was a student designed project, students would also be able to choose a topic they like.

Students are not always interested in every subject at school, in fact, most students are really only interested in one or two subjects at school. If schools allowed students to design their own project then they would be able to make their project about a topic that interests them. If it were a teacher designed project then students would be forced to do a project on a topic that they might not intersted and not want to put a lot of effort into it. If it were a student designed project then they would be able to do a project on a topic that interests them and would be more passionate about the project and would put a lot more effort into it. Students would be much more motivated to complete their projects over the summer if they could design their own projects arounds topics they have interests in. Student designed projects also allow students to design a type of projct they are good at.

Not all students are good at writing essays, not all students are good at using powerpoints. Every student is different with what they are comfortable using to create their projects and would prefer to choose how they can present their projects. If the summer projects were teacher designed, then students would not be able to choose how to do their projects. If the teachers decide that the project should be in a essay format, then some students would not be able to complete their project as well as the other students who are good at writing essays giving those students an unfair advantage. If the projects were student designed than each individual student would be able to choose their own project format that works best for them so that all students are on an equal level and no student is at a disadvantage. Allowing students to choose the format of their projects would also give students more motivation to complete the project and make it easier for them.

Overall students would put much more effort and thought into the projects over summer break if they were allowed to design their own projects. Teacher designed projects would make students less motivated to work and would cause students to not do their projects. Student designed projects overall would make the students much more motivated to complete the projects over summer break. The projects that are assigned to students over summer break should be allowed to be designed by the students because it gives the students more freedom, allows the students to choose a topic they are interested in, and allows students to create a type of project they are good at. ";0
"Limiting car usage comes with benefits for everything. It benefits the environent, yourself, and everyone else in the world.

If you use your car less or just use it when you need it, the amount of pollutants in the air from vehicle transportation would drop drastically. Vehicles are the second leading cause of pollution in the world behind factories. Cars are responsible for up to fifty percent of gas emissions in heavy traffic areas in the United States according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"". It is a very simple concept, cars produce gas emission, and using your car less can help protect the environment from pollutants.

The environment is not the only thing benefitted from limited car usage. You become healthier if you choose to totally lose the vehicle. Heidrun Walter stated  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage can also limit stress in a person. Besides being stress free, if you choose to walk to where you need to go, you exercise and do not realize it. Basically, if you want to lower your stress, not be tense, or be healthier, just limit your car usage and walk or ride a bicycle.

Vehicle accidents are a major cause of death in the world. So, if you decide to not use your car as much and just walk or bike, that is one less driver on the road. If the trend of limiting car usage and walking or biking spreads, the threats on the roadways will lower drastically. So in turn, using your car less can help keep everyone safe and help lower the amount of vehicle accidents and save lives.

With more people on the side walks, and less people behind the wheel, everyone can be benefitted. From stress to gas emission, everything can be solved with limiting your car usage.                                                    ";0
"Imagine being stuck at home all day and your mom being your teacher. How boring would that be right? Today we are going to take a side on if home school benefits more or if going to school does. Most schools give everyone this option to home school due to if the student can't make it to school for a reason. But they recommended going to school because it is a better way to learn. I feel like everyone learns and gets to experience more when you actually step out the house and go to school.

However people who think online school is more benefical have their reasons. Such as being able to go at their own pace or simply how it is easy to reach. These all are some benefits that online school does have, but i believe that going to school gives you these benefits and way much more. Although some people believe online school is better, Actually going to school can benefit students more because you are able to interact with more people and can seek extra help.

A big reason why going to school is better is that students get more of a experience. What does that mean? Well what i mean by that is students get to actually discover and learn more about what they are studying. For example if a student gets an option to study fahion at home or at a school in New York. It would be way much better to go study in New York because you are able to talk to industrys and other people who are into fahion as well. So if students go to school they would not online learn about the topics they are studying, but they would get speaking and other skills as well.

Also another big reason is looking for extra help or learning more than what they know. If students do online school they would'nt be able to look for extra help if they get stuck on a unit. For example this one time i could'nt make it to school due to a sickness, so I attempted learning what i missed on my own, but I did not understand it till i went back to school and my teacher expained it to me. If students got stuck like me and could not go to a resource like a school to look for help. How would they learn?

This is why i believe online school is not as benefical as they make it sound to be. So this is why going to school can benefit you way much more than online school. You dont get the benefits of interacting, experiencing and takling to other students. Overall online school will not benefit students in my opinion due to its lack of intercation with the outside world.";0
"The Electoral college is something that has been around for hundreds of years, and has helped us decide what to do. It is a fair method of electing the president, but it is not what we need anymore. Times have changed since that was established, so it is time we use a good old-fashioned way of voting, and use election by popular vote.

Back in the seventeenth century, when the Electoral College was created to find a balance between citizen voting and majority vote. How it works, is we select the electors representing our state's votes, they meet and vote, and then congress counts their votes. Also, all states, except Maine and Nebraska have something called the ""winner-take-all"" syatem, and that is a ""system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.""(s1,p7) But now, the citizens in your state who qualify as a voter cast their votes. Instead of that being what our state's choice is, we choose the electors of our candidate, or person we voted for, and then the candidate with the majority votes wins, getting atleast 270 out of 538 electoral votes. This seems very unfair, and in one specific case, it is. In the 2000 presidential election, between Al Gore and George Bush, Al Gore got more popular votes than George Bush; he should have won. But Bush had more electoral votes, and that was where is mattered. So, Bush won that. If Gore won popularity wise, he should have won, hense creating happier citizens, since he won the majority of their votes.

Another argument, according to source 3, paragraph 23, is that the Electoral College method of choosing the president, ""may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" This is very important, as we all want a good leader who will support our home state. If, for example, the Electoral College voted on a Democrat, and he won, Florida may not have much hope. Florida is a Republic state, as is most of the southern states; yes, Mr. President would be obligated to help all 50 states when necessary, but the bigger benefits would go towards the Democratic states, and probably his home state. Therefore, voters may not even bother casting in a ballot if the candidate of their choice does not have much hope, or if they think either potential leader will benefit them. So if they do not have much of a choice in the matter, they lose interest and shrug it off, as opposed to if it were popular vote, and every single vote was accounted for. Fortunately, though, this does not happen often; one meesly vote does not do much to turn the tables.

The Electoral College, all-in-all, has helped us a lot, yes, but it is high time we go back to the popularity vote. It would make most citizens, and many potential voters, happier to know that they are accounted for, and we won't have the potential of the popularity winner, the one the people actually voted for, to lose on account of the electors. It should be the people of America's decision, not a group of government workers, to decide who runs our nation.    ";0
"""If you want it you have to see it with a clear eye view."" This is a lyric from Meek Mill's song, Dreams and Nightmares. If students are expected to benefit from a situation and understand the material, they have to be present in the correct environment in order to have a better understanding of the material, which allows them to have a clear eye view. Being in a school setting does not only allow them to have a better understanding of the material, but it also minimizes the possible distractions that learning from home may include. Online classes are not always reliable, the internet can stop working at any time or technical difficulties can occur. Students are more likely to succeed in academic subjects if they're in a school environment which allows them to be fully submerged in their studies, it provides them with skills that may be useful; it gives them the opportunity to create friendships and memories that may impact them for a lifetime.

One's performance and achievement can be heavily impacted by the environment they are in. Students have a better understanding of subjects they're being taught if they're in the adequate learning environment. Students taking online classes can be easily distracted by technological devices that are easily accessible especially in the comfort of their own home. The separation of school life and home life can have a positive impact on a student's life. For example, if a student is having problems at home, they can escape them temporarily by going to school. This allows them to have a mental break which can help improve their overall health and well being. Constantly being at home creates an imbalance by mixing a student's academic focuses with their personal life. They'll end up not dedicating the sufficient amount of time nor attention to either one. Having a designated location for school allows students to better understand the material, it also creates their own space for their personal life.

School is not only a place where one can learn, it is also a place where students can develop multiple skills that will carry on with them throughout their life. For example, being in a typical classroom requires one to perform many tasks such as presenting in front of the class or working with classmates. These tasks allow students to develop social skills, teamwork skills, and communication skills to name a few. On the other hand, students taking online classes may not be able to acquire the amount of skills that students attending school have. These are crucial skills that will help them when they enter the work force, as well as in their everyday life. For instance, individuals that are home schooled may not be as comfortable or used to being around people, which can create difficulties for them when they stop taking classes; due to the fact that many jobs require one to work with others as a team. Which ultimately benefits those who have had prior experiences in those situations.

The memories and friendships one creates in school are carried on throughout one's life. Individuals who attend school have the opportunity to meet and bond with others. They can create memories and experiences that one can only obtain in a school setting. Some examples of this include: school dances, sports games, after school clubs, and assemblies. These are the events that are the most memorable from attending school. Attending a classroom enables students to form relationships with their teachers, which can facilitate the learning process. Taking online classes may keep one from experiencing what makes going to school and learning more enjoyable.

Attending school comes with many memorable experiences, most students who take online classes do not get to experience these memorable events. The environment one is in can greatly affect one's academic performance, which is why school would be the best environment to learn in since it's free of distraction, which cannot be guaranteed from attending online classes from home. The internet is not always reliable, it can go out at any moment which negatively affects a student's learning. Online classes would not be the most ideal when it comes to benefiting a student; learning in a school setting will improve a student's performance, it gives them the opportunity to make friendships and memories, and it allows them to develop crucial skills that they'll always need.";0
"Driverless cars are not a good idea and I am not for them. Driverless cars are very expensive to begin with. Uprgrades to public roads need to be done for the Smarter Cars to be driven on. The massive upgrades to the roads will also cost too much money.

Self driven cars still do not meet all safety measures, that's why it is illegal to drive on the road with them in most states. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. They all require the driver to drive throught work zones and around accidents. Why shouldn't the driver just drive all the time if you have to drive through little things like work zones? Driving doesn't require much skill besides being aware of your surroundings. What else do you have to do in a car on the road? Driving should be a basic human skill for all people in the world today.

Almost all driving laws help secure the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Keeping these laws are best achieved with alert human drivers. You never know when the computer in the car will malfuction, or when the devices will just suddenly stop working. If the technology fails, the blame goes on the manufacturers. There will most likely be a lot of court cases that the car companies will have to deal with if the cars malfuction.

The self driving cars will cost a lot less money on gas, nearly 50 percent of gas will be saved. But the money that you save on gas, doesnt make up for how much the car will cost, how much the upgraded roads will be, and the risk you are taking letting a computer drive you around wherever you want to go, even when you have to do some of the driving yourself. The cost of the gas does not make up for how much everything else will cost.

I am not for driver less cars. Most of the self driving cars will come down to two things, money and safety. It will cost to much money for everything with the cars besides gas. There still isn't enough safety being provided in the vehicles. The upgrades that need to be done, you dont know if they will be safe and you know the cost of them will be really high. I am not for driver less cars.";0
"Dear Principal,

Everyone is entitled to their own personal opinions on certain subjects. For example, opinions about community service. Some kids think its a waste of time to help out around the community, when they have their own stuff to do or worry about. But others feel strongly about making a change or difference in where they live, and keeping everything clean and organized. I myself like to do community service because it makes me feel good about myself that I can effect someone's life in a good manner, but not everyone is like me. I don't think students should be forced to perform community service because all of us are growing up and needing to learn to make our own choices. But talking to all kids and trying to encourage them to make that decision on their own is a good way to start.

We all have things we need and want to do, but we all have spare time too. Anyone can perform community service in their spare time, even if its just a few moments of it. Little goes a long way in such a eat or be eaten world. People always think community service is going out of your way to help someone, but its much more than that. Helping someone in need and making a difference in their life, or making the area around you like where you live is a great feeling. We need to encourage kids to take part in community service, but not force them too.

As teenagers grow up more and more, they begin the see the big picture of how life works. Many challenges will come your way, especially as you get older. But of course, you know that. So you understand how children our age can be, because you've been in our spot before. We always think we know everything and we're always right. That's why its difficult to convince teenagers to make the";0
"Firstly a teacher or a student to design a summer project. Most students would say to let them design it. But with this generation the smartest choice would be to let the teacher do it. Because they're the ones with the experience with making these projects. If they told me to sit down and make a project I wouldn't even know where to begin. Like kids these days barely know how to tie their own shoe. One expects them to do a whole project for them to do in the summer.

Teachers literally learned how to teach, how to make test/projects, how to make it make sense and not be all over the place, also how to make it fun for the student. Teachers study for how many years four or five for what to let a student do their job and make their own project. The student isn't learning anything from making his own project. The only real thing they would learn is how to put a project together. But if I had to do it I wouldn't even learn that I would try to make the project simple for me so I wouldn't have to do a lot of work.

Also kids these days have gotten really lazy, for example, my little sister in the summer she doesn't do anything but be on her phone and in bed all day. I couldn't imagine her doing a project in the summer nor less make one. A student wouldn't make the project difficult they would make it as easy as possible. They would probably make themselves just draw a picture of what they did in the summer. Students don't want to learn in the summer that's their time off when they get a break. No student that I know wants to do any work in the summer and most kids I know wouldn't even do it.

I remember getting a project in the summer when I was in the sixth grade. The teacher also made it and to be honest it was a large project but it help. The next year when we reviewed when we came back from summer I wasn't lost I still remembered a lot of information because of that project. But if a student had made it he wouldn't even know what to put on it. I would've been screwed because I would've done a project a kid made that didn't even know what we learned about that year. Teachers just knows what to put it together and how to organize it and that helps a lot.

If they just let teachers do it and make the projects students would learn more then if a student made it. We also always get those kids that don't do it either way. Just let the teachers do their job and make it they have more experience then a kid that is just always on their phone. The student also has a better chance of actually learning if the teacher makes it, then if the student made it themselves. In the end of the day the program just wants to make kids learn and get the information they need. So just the the professionals do it. ";0
"My principle has made a decision that requires all students to participate in extracurricular activities. Such as sports, yearbook, or student council. Most students would disagree with his decision, however, I agree with his decision. By having students participate in extra curricular activities, students can find something that benefits them. There is an activity for every student to benefit from by participating.

One activity a student can participate is sports. My school offers, spring,fall, and winter sports every student is given the chance to try out. It is a great opportunity for students who like being active or want to become more active to have fun and become part of a team where they can form strong bonds with their teammates. Who may share the same interest as them. Which is why joining a sport as an extracurricular activity is a good option to take part in.

Another activity that students can take participate in is student council. Student council offered to those who want to be more active in there school. Student council members are typically in charge of supporting students views in what should be done in our school. By students joining the council the school would have more student views in what should be done to help. Improve or have fun school activities throughout the school year. If students would like to become more active in strongly believe this is a good activity for them.

My final activity I believe is a great activity option for students to participate in is Yearbook club. Yearbook is a club that makes or designs the yearbook. For students who enjoy creating, marketing, and photography, Yearbook is a great option for them. The club consist of four teams, Design, writing, marketing, and Photography. Students can choose to take part which ever one they choose. Writing team goes around interviewing students and staff, marketing team creates flier and how much the yearbook will cost. Photography takes pictures of the schools' events, teachers and staff, and clubs. Finally we have design team, they put everything together to create the yearbook. If students are interested they are given the chance to join, just like with every club and activity my school offers.

As I stated before our school offers plenty of extracurricular activities for students. Each one benefits each student, the activities I have described were just a few that I strongly believe are great options to take part in. Sports help you stay active and fit, student council helps students become more active in pushing students views,and a yearbook allows students to take part in the delevopemet of the yearbook using skills they have. Taking part in extracurricular activities are beneficial to every student. They just have to find on they enjoy doing, Which is why I strongly agree with my principles decision, students should take extracurricular activities.";0
"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that there are many ways we can accomplish more in life. In this essay, I will discuss three ways we can achieve our goals and make a positive impact on the world around us.

Firstly, we can help our parents by being responsible and independent. By taking on household chores and responsibilities, we can reduce the burden on our parents and show them that we are capable of taking care of ourselves. For example, we can help with cooking, cleaning, and laundry. Additionally, we can also help with grocery shopping and running errands. By doing these tasks, we not only help our parents but also learn valuable skills that will benefit us in the future.

Secondly, we can help our community by volunteering and participating in community service. By volunteering, we can help those in need and make a positive impact on our community. For example, we can volunteer at a local food bank, animal shelter, or hospital. We can also participate in community events such as clean-up days, charity runs, and fundraisers. By doing these things, we not only help our community but also learn valuable skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication.

Lastly, we can be active for our health by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. By doing these things, we can improve our physical and mental health, which will benefit us in the long run. For example, we can eat a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. We can also exercise regularly by doing things such as running, swimming, or playing a sport. By doing these things, we not only improve our health but also learn valuable skills such as discipline and self-control.

In conclusion, there are many ways we can accomplish more in life. By helping our parents, helping our community, and being active for our health, we can make a positive impact on the world around us and achieve our goals. It is important to remember that every action we take has a consequence, and we should strive to make choices that will benefit not only ourselves but also those around us.";1
"It might be valuable, because it would be easy to see if a student is bored or confused. That might help around the class a bit, especially if a student lies if they know a certain subject everyone just learned, but that certain student either didn't pay attention because they were bored, or they were just confused about the subject. With this technology, you can help them out and maybe it would be efficient.

In the article it says, ""You can use the technology to see if a student is bored or confused."" Since that was said, I think it would be a good idea to use that in a classroom. Like I said in my claim, a student might be lying, so using this technology might help out you and your student.

In conclusion,the technology is helpful and can probably help out other people too, not just students. People can lie about their mood and can feel down, but if you use this technology, you might see that something is wrong with the person because of how they feel, and you might be able to help them out. This technology is helping the world become a better world.";0
"They should change to election by popular vote. The people have a right to decide so shouldn't they. We elect electors and not the president that's not right. They electors have changed the votes around. The elctoral college should go. Athough there is a positive look to it.

Letting the people vote is the right thing. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of elcetors, who in turn elect the president.""(Bradford Plumer). So the poeple dont truely decide who becomes president. At least not if we choose the electors and the elctors choose the president. The voting system needs to change.

Who's to say that the elctors dont change the votes around. ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.""(Bradford Plumer). So is that possible. The people of the United States don't have control over the elctors except the fact that they choose them. The electors could totally go against the people even though, say one person may have had more votes against this other person. Then the electors liked the person who was loosing so the choose that person anyway. Who's to say that they havent done it before. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888."" So this did accure twice.

""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""(Ofiice of the Federal Register). So it does have a positive side to it. It's a good thing to have to keep the power balanced through out the voting process. So having the Electoral College may not truely be a bad idea. Although there will always be that inbetween group known as the electors.

So they should still change the Electoral College over to elections by the people. The voting system needs fixing. The elceltors have chance the vote twice who's to say they won't do it again. The Electoral College can be good at some aspects. Still the power should always remain with the people and that's how it should be.                                                          ";0
"I think that using driverless cars are a positive thing. There are some negatives that come along, but everything has negatives with them. There are more positives to outweigh the negatives. I think it will be much safer and enviromentally friendly.

Just think about all the drunk drivers out there. With the driverless car you do not have to worry about anymore. There are also a very high amount of people that text and drive or just on there phone. That is a bg safety issue. Again, the driverless car controls everything so you will not have to worry about any crashes or accidents because of people on there phone.

It makes it easy to get places. There is a built in GPS, so the car already knows where to go. People get lost all the time because they dont know what to do or where to go. Yes the car does make the driver actually drive when there is a lot of traffic or construction, but by the time these cars come out I am sure that problem will be fixed. Even if the problem does not get fixed, the car will still have done most of the driving for you. It makes it so much easier on the people using the driverless cars.

The driverless cars are extremely safe. There are sensors all over the car to show it how close thing are, when to stop, and where to go. There is another sensor that uses satellites to give it a map out of the car on the road, and the roads at all time. That is an axtraorinary device.

The car only uses half the amount of gas that a normal car will use. That saves the owner of the driverless car a gigantic amount of money. It is also safer for the environent. If only half the normal gas amount is being used, then it is a geat thing for the Earth. There will not be as much drilling and sucking out of the gas. That will give the Earth more time to get more gas and it will last much longer for us to use.

There are some negatives with the driverles car. If there is to much traffic, construction sight, or just something the automobile cannot handle then the driver will have to take over. That is a problem because why would you need to have a driver driver a driverless car? The cars still are noot fully ready and prepared to be used yet, so that gives the manufacturers more time to fix all of the flaws. There could be technical problems with the car, but that comes with anything there is that is new. There are most likely a couple years before these cars will be ready to sell, so that leaves a lot of time to fix all the problems and flaws.

These driverless cars seem to be very safe, easy to use, easy to maintain, very helpful, and good for the environment. These driverless cars will be a ginormous help for everybody that is on the road. They are definitely a positive product for the world.";0
I agree wiith the principal when he say's all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and this is why I agree because it keeps the kids active I also awont' gree because it can be fun for the students exspcally if they have a friend or family member they like to see thats there and so they won't be lonely and it can also give you somethng to do after school it can aslo provide exercise for the students and keep the studethints healthy and if they get use to it they might carry on doing it and still try to do it in the future and this is another reason why I agree with the principal because the students won't be bored because it's boring if you have nothing to do after school or doing school hours and I also think it's a good idea because you can have stuff to talk about with your friends,family,peers,teachers,and others and other reasons why I agree is because some parents might won't there child or children staying active or being in a school activity beacuse they might wan't them to stay healthy and because might have to pick there child up at a certian time because of there job and there child will hityave have something to do after school while thier parent or parent's are at work so it keeps them occupied and so the parents won't be worried and I think another reason why it's a good idea is if they are playing sports like football,soccer,basketball,and others it will be good for them to play other schools and travel more reasons are when the the students grow up and ask them what was they childhood like they could say that they was active and healthy and always had something to do during school and after school with my friends because my principal said that we must do at least on extracurricular activity ;0
"""Ugh, I wish that I could just stay home and attend my classes online without having to leave home,"" I say to myself at least eight million times during the school day; taking a moment to think about it, I thought maybe this would be beneficial. Today we live in a society in which students attend classes on a daily basis, some who walk across the street to attend class, some who have at least an hour commute to attend class everyday, and some who take online courses, which is very beneficial. Although some may believe otherwise, students benefit substantially when they attend classes from their homes because it is an easier and more convenient option and some students may be unable to attend class due to an illness or disability.

First and foremost, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because this option is easier and much more convenient for students. For instance, my mom was very busy at home caring for my sisters and at the time, there was no way she would have been able to attend any sort of class, therefore, she found an online option for the University of Phoenix where she could earn a degree by completing an online course. Due to the fact that this option was an availability for her, she was able to earn her degree with the slightest of ease. Additionally, this convenience allowed her to still be able to care for my sisters and complete her online courses without the stress of attending the class in person. Undoubtedly, had she not had this easy and convenient option open to her, she would have never had the time to earn her degree. Another example of why attending online classes is easy and more convenient is when I was already late for class and then I got stuck in traffic on the way to my Spanish 3 class, resulting in me missing the entirety of the class. Had I been registered for the same class but online, I would have never missed the Spanish 3 final exam. For these reasons, online classes can be much easier, convenient, and beneficial when dealing with life's daily obstacles.

In most cases, online and video conferencing classes from home are beneficial to students because it enables a student who may be ill or disabled a chance to attend a class from their home, which may be a challenge for them if they were to attend it in person. For example, I have Lyme disease, which makes it difficult sometimes to attend class because I am always fatigue. With this in mind, I plan on taking a few online classes myself, and I am so glad that this option is offered for the school I want to attend, which is Virginia Tech. I will no longer have to worry about if I will have enough energy to get out of bed and make it to class or if my joint pain is just too much to bare because I have the benefit of being able to be within the comfort of my home and still attend class online. Certainly, had I not had this amazing, beneficial opportunity to attend class online, I would have not been able to attend class regularly, without it being somewhat challenging. Another example of why online and video conferencing classes are beneficial to a student with an illness or disability is illustrated the time my Generic_Name was in college and got an bad spinal and neck injury, allowing her to not be able to walk for months and having to be in a wheel chair. It was very difficult for her to attend her English, Psychology, and AB Calculus classes due to this disability. Her counselor recommended that she stayed home for a few months to recover and continue attending her very important classes via video conference while her professor was teaching. Ultimately, had she not reaped the benefits from attending her classes through video at home, it would have been an enormous task to make it to her classes on a daily basis. In conclusion, online and video conference classes are a huge advantage for students who have trouble attending their classes in person.

Some may disagree and say that online or video conferencing classes are not beneficial to students because they are not reliable enough to capture the actual environment of how a class my be like if a student were to attend it in person, resulting in an online student attendee not learning as much as a student who attends the same class in person. This reasoning is understandable, however, it is also flawed due to the fact that online courses teach the same exact curricula that is taught in an actual class. For instance, my friend Generic_Name took the same class that I did during the school year, however, she took the course online over the summer; the class was Economics and Personal Finance. When we both were tested on the material that we learned during the course, she scored higher than I did which shocked me. In conclusion, online classes have the same material and benefits just as much as an actual classroom has and does not hinder the knowledge gained for taking the class in either way.

Conclusively, it is important to understand that attending online or video conference classes from home are very beneficial to students because it is an extremely useful alternative to students. In the past, students never had the chance to benefit from this new, sophisticated way of learning through online or video conferencing and had to attend class in person because technology was not as advanced as it is today. In the future, technology will advance even more than it already has, making online courses even more beneficial, possibly resorting to only online teaching. Ultimately, students benefit substancially from attending classes via online or video conferencing and this option should always continue to remain an option for students that need the benefits that it has to offer.";0
"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, you should keep the grade requirement for grades how it is. Sometimes, what you're saying is true, kids need to focus more on school, but life isn't all about school, there are many life lessons that you can learn while playing sports, and to limit the opportunity for kids to learn these lessons wouldn't make any sense.

Sports teach us many thing, good work ethic, physical health, respect towards higher authorities, and many more. I, for one, was changed by sports drastically. At the beginning of basketball season, I didn't really have any concern for my grades. I slacked off, and my grades slowly started to slip a away. Until one day, my coach talked to me after practice, she was concerned that my grades would keep declining, until I could not longer play. This changed my attitude right around. Basketball means the world to me and not being able to play would make me feel like a failure at life and if that ever happened, I believe I would just give up and my grades would plummet. Basketball has also made me a hard worker. Not only did it help my grades, but it made me realize just how important hard work is. I made a connection one day, me and my friends worked hard at practice unlike some other girls, and me and my friends were the ones playing the whole entire game, I figured that situation is just like life, the people who work the hardest get the best deal in the end.

I understand though your concern on sports being a distraction to academics. There is a simple solution to this though that doesn't include limiting the people who can play. I think that you could just do as the wrestling coach does for all sports and make it so there is a homework time before practice starts. By doing this, there is no excuse for not getting homework done, and there is usually someone there who understands it if you need help.

Thank you for reading this. Hopefully you keep the requirements the same, for sports really are an important thing in life for many students here.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME";0
"Technology is improving more and more as time goes by, each year that goes by the technology we use gets smarter and smarter. Soon we may be in a world where everything consist of technology and requires technology. The future will be nothing like now or the past and the future generations will be born in futuristic society.

This text talks about driverless cars becoming a thing that'll soon change the ways of drving and how driving is. If there starts being cars that can drive without someone driving, maybe that'll prevent less car accidents and cassualties. Perhaps if there is cars that can drive by themselves when a person goes on a roadtrip they wouldn't have to worry about stopping to sleep and it would make getting from point A to point B a lot faster. Driverless cars seems like a brilliant ideal but there could many flaws about it.

I am for driverless cars because I believe that'll beneifit a alot of people. People who have disablities or are disabled from the waist down could actually be able to drive. Driverless cars could also help teens with driving and prevent teen car crashes from happening. Less drunk driving accidents would happen if there were driverless cars because if the cars drove by themselves that means a drunk person wouldn't be in control and there would be less deaths. driverless cars has its benifits but it also has its flaws.

The flaws of having driverless cars are that if something bad happened as said in the text who would be in the wrong for the accident, the driver or the manufactuerer? If something bad was to happen with the car, would the person be able to sue the manufacturer or would it be all on the person in the vehicle? If the weather got bad and the driverless cars wasn't progammed to be ready for the situation that could havoc. The manufacturer of the car would have to ensure that the car is smart enough and capable enough of driving through harsh weather conditions. Also how many people would actually have the money for a driverless car, assuming that it'll be expenisve.

In conclusion I do believe if maufacturers put in a lot of work and effort into driverless cars it'll be a success without a doubt. Driverless cars is a brilliant ideal and would actually benefit people. Driverless cars would be one of the first steps into a technology based world and society. The future will be here before we know it. ";0
"Being honest with friends and family is a fundamental aspect of any healthy relationship. However, there are situations where being truthful can be difficult, and it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of always being honest. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of honesty in relationships.

One of the most significant benefits of honesty is that it fosters trust. When people are honest with each other, they build a strong foundation of trust that can withstand any challenges that come their way. Trust is essential in any relationship, and it's impossible to have a healthy relationship without it. Additionally, honesty allows people to have open and honest communication, which is crucial in any relationship. When people are honest with each other, they can express their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or retribution.

However, there are also some disadvantages to always being honest. For example, honesty can sometimes be hurtful. Sometimes, people may not want to hear the truth, especially if it's something they don't want to believe. In such cases, honesty can cause tension and conflict in relationships. Additionally, honesty can sometimes be misinterpreted, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunication.

Another disadvantage of honesty is that it can be difficult to maintain in certain situations. For example, in some cases, it may be necessary to lie to protect someone's feelings or to avoid causing harm. In such cases, honesty can be detrimental to the relationship.

In conclusion, being honest with friends and family has its pros and cons. While honesty fosters trust and allows for open communication, it can also be hurtful, cause tension, and be difficult to maintain in certain situations. Therefore, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of honesty before deciding whether to always be truthful in relationships. Ultimately, the most important thing is to maintain a healthy and respectful relationship with those around us.";1
"Hey Luke here, in your childhood have ever wanted to be a cowboy or wanted to sail the seven seas?

Well why not be both with our Seagoing Cowboys program. I did it and it chaged my life forever.

You can enjoy being the best of both worlds while helping others.

It may be dangerous, but so is everything else. People need us, but we need you to help us.

You may wonder why should I help people I don't know? here are some of the things I saw and did that you will be able to do too.

You can see many parts of the world like China or Europe.

Also you may see Acropolis in greece or take a gondola ride in Venice.

Maybe even Italy with sreets of water, or Creete with its Panama Canal.

Also if you are 18 or older this counts as military service, and when it comes down to it it's more safe to deliver suplies on a boat than be in the battle lines of war.

Plus You are helping people around the world by delivering important suplies like horses, young cows, and mules. Though you will have to feed alot of horses you'll be ok. I fed 335 horses and I was ok.

In concusion that is why you should be a seagoing cowboy. You will see parts of the world you never seen before, you'll be serving your country, and you will help people around the world. Join and you won't regret it, I didn't and you wont ether I promise. We need more Seagoing Cowboys for our program.

This is Luke Bomberger saying will you be the man or woman to anwser our call?";0
"Students should be allowed to make their own decisions and to not be forced into doing any activities others choose for them or make them do. If they are unable to cooperate physically and/or don't have the right type of mindset they should not participate. Not having that compatibility with certain subjects that others may have might be challenging for others to look forward to. It would be enticing to do these events but if you don't have many ideas for these things, it's disappointing. People would really look forward to those plans but when you lack skills it is hard.

Sports festivals will need pros who can win in any games or peoples they face up against. In ""Work on the yearbook"" section you will need skills of editing, drawing arts and photography. Last for student council you will need lots of ideas and ways to help the community and plan events. For those events and activities people will need time to do so, If you are unable to have that time nor someone to pick you up from those things then it's harsh to find someone who is willing to do so. You will need a family member or a close friend who can drive because these events may carry on longer then school buses can manage to take you home.

These activities that you may force on us may be a good thing in your head and to some other people but when you come back to reality there's a bigger picture. All these plans you want us to have to do is very tiring and time consuming, many people may not have the capabilities to do so. Finding the right time, ideas and perfectly cut out people for the job is extremely hard. This may not be as easy as it seams especially for the young and maturing as they're still trying to figure out paths they want to go down for the future, and how their brains are still developing. Students shouldn't have to participte if they are not willing to. Leave the choice up to them. ";0
Home schooling is good for some people and bad for others it depends on on how they learn. Being at home most people couldn't focus, their would be to many distractions in a home. But at school a lot of things happen you can prevent a kid from getting bullyed by someone, or like catch a sickniss from somebody else you never know, somebody could be carrieing a virus or something. But learning from school is way is way easier because the teachers can teache easier, and if they over sleep because they don't have to go nowhere then they miss a day or don't do they work at home then gets held back because they have to much responseabilty. So going to school is good for a student so they can get more effective learning experience and they don't get held back for lack of work or in school time. If the student works best at home then let him becase it's mostlikely better for them if they chosed it or if parent chose it for them so. The school will offer safty at the school instead of your kid being at home with no one to watch them anything can happen to them. So what could be worse than coming to public school free food, free education, free security trust me come it would be much better to have your kid here than at home by them selves unlesss there is a home school teacher that you pay for but that coats a good amount of money a day so coming to public school would be the best move someone could someonne could make cheaper and better for any student. Plus your kid could get to know people and make friends instead of being alone for the school years they could be with they new friends and be out with them but thats also another reason to stay home becase the could take your kid down the wrong path and have them drugs or something and we wouldn't won't that for your kid we want whats best for even if that means home schooling them so that they get the education they for them to do good in life.;0
"Hi I am Luke and I want you to become a Sea Going Cowboy. Yes I know what you are thinking, what is a Sea Going Cowboy. Well let me tell you a little bit about it and lets see if you are interested.

A Sea Going Cowboy works for the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relif and Rehababilitation Administration). What I do is I take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped over seas.

Some of the benifits of my job is that if you are drafted into the army you can use this job for your service credit. One other benifit of my job is that I had the oppourtunity to see Europe, and China. But seeing the Acropolis of Greece was the best. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. I also was able have a tour of the great castle in Crete. Plus I was astounted at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Other benifits you might like if you like agriculture would be getting to feed the horses, clean the stalles. and pulling bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower parts of the ships. I definitly liked this part of the job because I grew up helping out on aunt Katie's farm and loved every minute of it.

Plus on your way home with out any responsibility to take care of the animals. you can play games like, basebal,volyball,table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading. and willting. These games also helped pass time on the way back from your journey across the seas.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than just a adventure for me. This experince made me relize how grateful I am. It also made me aware of people of other countris and their needs. It also opened my eyes up to the world to relize not everything is about me and my little small town, and that there are other peolpe in the world besides me who need help. And that awarenes I was talking about has stayed with me through my whole life. Leading to my family to host a numbe of international students and exchange vistors for many years now. All thanks to my freind Don for persuadeing me to become Seagoing Cowboy.      ";0
"Dear senator,

The Electoral College makes voting useless. If we want our voices to be heard as free citizens of this country then we should have full power over the votes. We are the people of America and we deserve to decide who takes the presidency. This country is our home and important to us and we deserve to be heard. I understnad that the Electoral College makes the whole voting process a whole lot easier, but it's not about easy. It's about our freedom and our freedom of speech.

The Electoral College is a system that selects electors to stand in place of us, but we the people aren't getting what we deserve. For example, if Florida has 29 electors and most of the state is voting for Romney, then those 29 electoral votes go to Romney. But suppose a smaller, less popular state like Wyoming only has 3 electors and most of the state votes for Obama; he only recieves 3 electoral votes. Now tell me, is that fair? Is it really?

Our purpose in the voting polls is disapperaing and now these candidates only count on the states that have the most electoral votes because they will count for more during the election. Candidates go around trying to win over the states with many electors and tend to ignore the ones with less. Even going as far as not advertising their campaigns. The Electoral College needs to be abolished so our country can be free once again.    ";0
"What would you think if a computer could read your emotions? The Facial Action Coding System is supposed to be on your computer and read your emotions. Professors at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Illinois are trying to work with the system to help their students. If you would use this system in a classroom it would be effective because it could recognize when you have mixed feeling about something or someone, when you are confused about something in class, and when you have empathy for someone else.

The system could help in class when someone has mixed emotions about someone or something. The article stated,""'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.'"" In class, kids show different emotions all the time. The system would help when they were confused about a subject.

If a student is confused about a subject, then they won't be productive in class. The article also stated that ""'the facial expressions for each emotion are universal.'"" Every human has several different emotions, but one emotion could represent more than one. The students could have mixed emotions about it. The system could help figure out how the student is feeling about something. The system not only helps with the mixed emotions aspect, but also the part where you don't quite understand something.

Students in classes will get confused or bored while in class. This use of technology will be valuable by realizing it and wanting to help. Dr. Huang predicted that ""'a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'""This system on the computer could help teachers and students realize when you aren't quite understanding a topic. The computer could then have a modified version of the lesson for the student to help get them to understand. Dr. Huang said,""' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The computer could help fill in as a teacher to help the confused student. If the student is taking a class online, then the computer could realize the emotion of the student and help out. This use of technology is not only going to be valuable for when the student doesn't understand something, but also when a person shows empathy.

Most people show empathy towards one another, and this technology could help show when someone is showing empathy. The article stated that "" you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" When your friend shows how they feel, you can be effected by it too. The system could help realize if you are not your usual self because you may have empathy for someone else. your emotions could get you distacted from your school work, and then you might struggle in that class. The article aslo stated that "" faces don't lie: these muslce clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" The computer will be able to tell when you have a false emotion on your face. If you aren't being honest with your emotions, then the emotions the computer realizes could effect how you work in class.

Having a system to help read when you have mixed emotions, are confused, or have empathy is why the Facial Action Coding System can help students in the classroom. The way student feel and act can effect the way students do in their school work. The Facial Action Coding System would be valuable for students in school. ";0
"This idea on making cars that drive on there own its sounds pretty cool but the money put into and the accidents that come from it are waiting this would be the worst mistake in history. Any car itself is very dangerous to be in while driving because of maybe your driving skils or other peoples driving skills. The time and effort put into this experiment will be hard and confusing but it would be a big waste of time for the makers of the car and the manufacturers on the company. People and companies say this would be a good investment and the best choice ever but if everything turns out bad your company is going straight down the drain.

There are many reasons this is a horrible idea and a big waste of time and money. This would be very dangerous for the drivers and other drivers on the road anything could happen in a matter of seconds anf you could take someones life or even your own life. Manufacturers say this will be a great acheievment i agree but the chances of this coming out as a positive invention is beyond me. Its dangerous enough on the roads with cars but by making cars driverless is beyond dangerous it will cause so many distractions and so many deaths.

The cost of making these cars and testing them will cost so much money and if the cars dont work and experiments with them dont work it will be drastic. Alot of people will be paying for these experiments with there taxes ands thats not fair for people that work hard for there money to just through it away on the invention. This would also be a big problem in are money and state money because if it doesnt work and they wasted all that money are state could possible become in debt. All this money put into will be a waste and companys will probably be shut down and that will be the end of it for them.

The risks that we are taking are really risky there are so many things that can go wrong and that will cost you and other peoples lifes. Its dangerous enough with drunk drivers and children walking on roads but if the driverless cars get invented this will cause so many accidents and possible alot of deaths. The accidents could be caused by anything messing up in the car sensors or the brakes. The brakes or sensors could stop working or jam up and drivers wouldnt even know if there sleeping that would be it for them and also if people or other drivers are around that could possible end there life just for cars that can drive by there selfs.

All this driverless car stuff is a big mistake and could be a problem in are state in so many ways. It will possible cost lifes and companys to be shut down and become in debt. All this oh it works we tested it a thousand times it dont matter anything could happen and any point and these mistakes at any point will be horrible and the end for alot of people. This invention in all will be dumb and stupid and the money and risks were taking on this is risky.";0
"Distance learning has become a popular option for many students, and with it, certain risks and benefits arise. While remote learning can offer an accessible and flexible learning experience, it can also have adverse effects on student attendance and cheating. 

When it comes to attendance, many students may find themselves less inclined to actively participate in classes due to lack of in-person interaction. This can result in low levels of engagement, and may lead to poor learning outcomes. Furthermore, there is an increased possibility that students may cheat on tests or quizzes when not supervised by teachers. To counteract this, teachers must find innovative solutions to ensure that students do not take advantage of online learning.

Distance learning can also have an impact on teachers' jobs, as they may feel overworked or lack the freedom to instruct classes in their usual manner. However, when adapted properly, remote learning can be an effective method of teaching that can benefit both teachers and students.

The potential of students dropping out of school while learning from home is also a concern. Without regular attendance or in-person supervision, more students may remain long-term absent from school, impeding their learning progress. Governance must be implemented to ensure distance learning is effective but not abused. 

All in all, while there are risk associated with distance learning, there are also many positive aspects, such as enhanced access to education for students who may otherwise struggle to attend school. With the right strategies in place, distance learning can be a safe and beneficial educational system.";1
"In the current era, you never have to step foot in a public school ever again. Yes, you are still lawfully required to complete the majority of your secondary education, but the ever growing access to laptops and other electronic devices has introduced a new method for students to earn their highschool diplomas. Some school districts now permit their students to learn and participate in class via internet or video conference. While this innovation may seem like a peek into the future of American schools, it is not without its share of faults. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in typically absent-causing.

After every school year, students are expected to show mastery of the cirriculums in each of their core classes. What the final exams fail to measure, however, are the other critical life skills that students obtain in the classroom. For example, group projects do more for the individual than teach them a bunch of facts and figures. They also simulate the level of collaboration students will use regularly as future members of the workforce. Similarly, assigning nightly homework goes deeper than the teacher's desire to keep their pupils busy, as learning to balance piles of graded assignments is an effective way to teach lessons about time management. Taking online classes will enact these same skills to an extent, though the lack of classmates combined with a more flexible schedule puts students in a bit of a bubble. In other words, school becomes less about practical application and focuses significantly more on pure academic knowledge. While online classes accomplish the same goal in their cirriculums, they fall terribly short in teaching students other important life skills.

social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to ""quiet down"" and ""focus on their assignments"", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers. Online classes, with their isolated environment, cause students to lack the same interaction and attention they recieve at school everyday.

Of course, schools would not offer their students online classes if it came with zero benefits. There is a strong arguement to be made in favor of virtual schooling when students are abesent for an extended period of time. When faced with extreme situations, like severe illness or family emergencies, students must also stress over catching up on their work upon returning to school. Online classes would allow these students to complete assignments and learn course material outside of the classroom. Nonetheless, this peace of mind is only applicable if the student is mentally and/or physically capable to do schoolwork while enduring such a taxing hardship. Online classes may come in handy when students would usually miss school, even the pros are of this school system are laced with cons.

The debate of online classes in place of traditional schooling is a complicated one. Allowing students to complete their academic career without actually attending school may help keep them on track, as they could continue to learn in situations that would otherwise require an absence, but at what price? Online classes cause students to miss out on important life lessons and practical skills, such as collaboration and time management, due the the structure of the assignments. Additionally, students will have less opportunites to interact with their peers and create long-lasting memories at school-sponsered events. For now, it is in the best interest of the children and the future society to keep students in the classroom. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in absent-causing situations. ";0
"Imagine a world completely pollution free. A world with no worry about greenhouse gases or global warming. While it's highly unlikely that we will get to that point, we can still try to reach this perfectly healthy world. The are many advantages tolimiting car use, some of those advantages would be: reducing stress, reducing the amount of pollution, and saving money.

Stress is a feeling that everyone can relate to. Whether it be work, school, money, or home life stressing out about things is not healthy. There has been several studies showing that getting proper exercise has tremendous health benefits. The only problem is that no one ever seems to have time to work out or go on a walk. However, if you had to walk to get wherever you're going, you would easily recieve enough exercise to help lower your stress. Plus, driving can be extremely stressful. Without having to sit through traffic or deal with bad drivers an average person's stress levels would plummet. The first passage contains a quote from a suburban mom of two, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier this way.""

Recently, I feel as if all I hear about on the news is Greenhouse gases and pollution. Honestly, hearing about global warming is a frightening experience, almost like a glass of cold water being thrown in your face. 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are caused by passenger cars and in parts of the United States it's up to 50 percent! While car companies are helping by rolling out hybrid and electric cars, those cars are very expensive! Not everyone is willing to shell out that kind of money. By reducing car use, the harmful gases polluting our air will greatly decrease and places like Paris,France and Beijing, China (both ver heavily polluted places) can have clearer air.

Money. Money seems like it rules our world and it really does. Do you enjoy throwing moeny away? Of course you don't! Well, if you drive a car everywhere you go, you might as well be. Gas prices are high and it takes upwards of 50 dollars to fill the tank of the average car. Not to mention the price of the car itself! While you have to pay for gas, car insurance, maintence, and the bill for the car if it's not paid off yet, people who walk to work or to the store and don't own a car are saving thousands of dollars a year.

To conclude, when you reduce the use of cars you: reduce stress, reduce the amount of pollution, and save money. If you want to leave the planet Earth healthy and livable for the future generations, you should seriously consider ditching your car and buying a nice pair of walking shoes.    ";0
"Hey, so like, I'm gonna write this essay about Michelangelo's statement and stuff. So, he said that the greater danger for most of us is not setting our goals too high and failing, but setting them too low and achieving them. Like, yeah, I get it.

So, let's think about this. When we set our goals too low, we're not challenging ourselves enough. We're not pushing ourselves to be the best we can be. And that's like, super dangerous because then we're just gonna be mediocre and not achieve anything really cool.

For example, like, if I wanted to be a pro basketball player, but I only set my goal to be good enough to play on my school team, I'd never make it to the NBA. I'd be stuck playing for my school team forever, and that's not what I want. I want to be a pro basketball player! So, I need to set my goal higher and work harder to achieve it.

Another example is in school. If I only set my goal to get C's and B's, I'm not gonna be able to get into a good college. I want to get into a college that's gonna help me achieve my dreams, but if I don't set my grades high enough, I might not get in. So, I need to set my goal higher and study harder to achieve it.

And it's not just about school and sports. This applies to life in general. If we don't set our goals high enough, we're not gonna be happy with our lives. We're gonna be stuck in a rut, doing the same thing every day, and that's not what we want. We want to be happy and fulfilled, and that only comes from setting our goals high and working hard to achieve them.

So, in conclusion, Michelangelo was right. The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low and achieving it. We need to set our goals high and work hard to achieve them, not just settle for mediocrity. Thanks for reading!";1
"It isn't fair to let someoe vote for someoe and then for said someone that that they voted for swing and vote for someone else that the person didn't lean to vote for. In my own opinion, we should get rid of the Electoral College, because we sometimes do not get what we voted for.

Why have electoral votes that may not get the president you want? In paragraph nine of Source Two it states how over sixty percent would prefer a direct election. So the question is, why not do it? Sixty out of one hudred percent would prefer it, so why not atleast give it a try? Having a whole state have to decide what party to choose from doesn't seem fair. Ifwe had a direct election, then the President with the most votes out of the whole country would be the rightful President. It seems as if the Electoral College isn't quite acurate.

Getting rid of the Electoral College would change the U.S. a lot. It hopefully would be a good change. If it was gone, we could all hope that we would get whom we wated in office by a direct election. In paragrapgh four-teen, Source Two, it says that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" The outdated part of that sentence is true. The electoral College was enforced in 1888 and has since been used by voters today. It's time for a change and a direct election should be that change. What is so bad that could happen?

The Winner-Take-All method would be gone. Voting in an Electoral College is like voting for your vote to have the most votes, like in school, you want to pick what game you play so you vote and whatever has the most, you play. Except in voting for Presidency your vote goes to whatever your state has the most of. Which seems unfair. You basically just vote to vote, so It's only a big win for you if what party you voted for is what your state goes with.

The staes determine who is the President during an election. The electoral votes have an effect on the state. 538 electors throughout the whole country. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. According to Source One, your state is entilted to how many members in cogress you have, plus two for each senator. So you the voter have no say on what party they all decide to lean towards. But in a direct election, your vote counts.

To conclude, we should all consider to try and make direct election happen. It would help your chance of the candidate the you vote for become President.                     ";0
"When was the last time you drove a car? Studies have shown that the amount that people have driven over the last couple of years has gone down. There are lots of advantages to limiting car usage. Some of them include: less gas emmisions, emptier and safer streets, and new innovations to compensate for the reduction of car usage. Plenty of cities around the world have attempted limiting car usage.

To start off, if citizens limit their car usage, there would be less gas emissions. But, unfortunately there are still plenty of greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. There are other options to do instead of driving, you could skate, bike, walk, or etc. The gas emissions are a huge problem in today's society and we have to change something about the way we live. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, they have a car-free day once a year.  This reduces the smog that is kept in the air from the gas emissions.

Continuing on, if citizens limit their car usage, we would have safer streets for sure. With less cars driving up and down the street, kids can feel free to play in the street without having to worry about a reckless driver coming down and mowing them all down. Even suburban planners in the US are trying to create ""car reduced"" communities. Instead of using cars, public transportation is becoming the new thing.

Lastly, with people not using cars to get everywhere, some innovations would be made. Side walks would be reconstructed, less rush-hour traffic, new restaraunts and shopping districts within walking distance, and parks and sport centers would blossom. In Bogota, all of those have blossomed since they have started it back in the mid-90s. With the end of car culture also, new innovations have to spring up.

To close out, cars are being used less and less. And they should be because they cause gas emissions, unsafe streets, and bad construction. But, we are slowly moving away from that culture and who knows what into!    ";0
"While cars have made our lives so much simpler in the aspect of transporting ourselves efficiently, there are a few drawbacks. Some cities have made efforts to reduce these drawbacks. Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution and saves money but makes transportation less efficient.

Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution. An example of this is in Paris when they had a smog problem, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Paris had a smog problem, and limiting car usage prved to be an effective solution. Another example of limiting car usage cutting down on pollution is in Bogota, Colombia. They had a car-free day to reduce smog. ""cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million."" Colombia has a day without cars to cut down on air pollution. This has beed proven to be an effective solution to smog.

Clearly, living without cars is not only a vision of environmentalists, it's a reality. Cars could eventually no longer be needed if more countries support this movement. If this creative, clean craze hits America, we might have a future that is a breath of fresh air.    ";0
"In the French and Swiss borders, Vauban streets are completely car free. In Vauban Germany, enforcements are very strict on car policy. Some people even have to sell their car to move there. Although, car ownership is allowed, but it is only to be parked in large garages along with a home for $40,000. Because of this 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars.

In 2006 Vauban grew a trend in Europe of separating Suburban life from auto use to ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes."" They called this ""Smart Planning.""

While there had been effort to make the city denser during the past few decades, Vauban had gave 5,500 home to residents, making it less accessible to public transportation, and less space for parking. This leaded to the making of the environmental Protection Agency. This agencies promotion was to reduce car use. In the result of the agency, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highway and only 20 percent to other transport.

Germany doesn't seem to be the only one to ban cars. Driving in Paris has been ban due to smog. Paris banned driving due to near-record pollution. To confiscate, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear to air. Along with the driving ban, a fine was included too for some. On Monday motorists with even numbered liscense plates were told to leave their car at home or recieve a fine of $31. Odd plates would suffer the same consequence as well the following day. This all led to approximately 4,000 drivers being fined. After five-days of intensifying smog, conjestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france. No surprise, the diesel fuel was blamed for the incident. Accordingly it mentions diesel makes up about 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Gradually, in one week, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to recsind the ban for odd-numbered plates the next day.    ";0
"Some schools are given summer project to assure students continue learning throughout the summer. Since, the summer project is completed over the summer I believe it should be student-designed. First reason being is cause students should be able to make the project as they please as this embraces their imagination as to how they would like it to be and not just lock up any possible ideas they might have. Another being, it'll let the student complete the project to the best of their ability. Lastly, teacher-designed projects can get a bit stressful and overwhelming. Summer projects can benefit the students more if they're student-designed.

Student-designed projects allow the student to create the project freely with no restraints. For example, several weeks ago my forensics teacher gave her classes a project based on serial killers. The project was all up to the student except for the fact that it had to be a cereal box. It was fairly easy, we just had to pick a serial killer that we were interested in and also write fun and interesting facts about said serial killer. Very little were bad or plain, meanwhile, others were fun and entertaining with games, crosswords, toys, and other activities! I believe since we were able to do it on our own it enabled the class to receive higher scores on the project; therefore, we should be given student-designed projects.

Teacher-designed projects can get a bit excessive at times with a lot of work which eventually lead to stressful and overwhelming situations. For example, before this school year started several friends of mine were gonna take AP US History, which they had received a summer project for the class. Their was summer was okay until about a week before school started. That's when they realized they should've started weeks ago as the project was a packet with several pages of questions. Frantically and desperately they began their summer assignment, and well they may have lost some sleep due to staying up late but they ended up finishing. Although, my best friend had it the worse since she began her day with morning conditioning, followed by her going to work, and lastly afternoon practice and the stress from the summer project did't help. AP teacher-designed projects are lengthy and extra, which is why one should prefer student-designed projects.

In conclusion student-designed projects allow a student to be free with their own creativity and knowledge which allows them to work to the best of their ability. Also they don't produce as much stress as the teacher-designed projects. Lastly from other people one learns some teacher-designed projects can induce more stress into ones life which leads to other negative effects. Which is why teachers should make student-designed projects to let their students creativity roam free. ";0
"I do not think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable when using it to read students' emotions. I have many reasons why I am against this new technology. I believe that unless a person wants to share his or her emotions then nobody else has any business knowing what that person is feeling. My three main reasons why I am against this are because some people hide their emotions because they don't want other people to know about them, emotions are personal, and this new technology will invade the privacy of people.

Fist of all, I will be talking about my first reason that I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I am against it because some people hide their emotions so that way other people don't see them. Many people in the world like to keep their emotions to themselves. They do not like others to know how they feel, but with the new software it will be almost impossible for people to keep the emotions to themselves. In the caption underneath the picture of Mona Lisa, there is a sentence that says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" That sentence explains that this new software will be able to tell exactly how a person feels. No matter how hard the person is trying to hide their feelings they will no longer be able to fool anyone because of the Facial Action Coding System.

Second of all, I will talk about my second reason why I am against this new software. The second reason why I am against this software is because emotions are personal. They are not to be put out in the open all the time. When someone is experiencing negative emotions he or she may want to keep those personal feelings private. Paragraph 7 and 8 state that the face uses different muscles when fake smiling and real smiling. If a person is not happy and uses a fake smile then he/she is most likely indicating that he/she does not want to share his/her emotions with another individual. This software can detect which musles in the mouth are being used when smiling. This means that fake smiles will no longer fool someone who uses this software.

Last of all, I will be taking about my final reason that I am against this technology. This technology is an invasion of privacy towards people. The caption underneath the picture states that this software can detect exactly how a person is feeling. Imagine if this techonolgy was used on a student who had a lot a personal and private things going on in his/her life that made him/her not want to talk about his/her emotions, but then comes along a new software that can detect the emotions of a person. If this is used on that student then that student's private and personal emotions were just uncovered. What if that student didn't want people to know? It's too late now and that student feels worse because he or she did not want them to be known. Emotions and feelings will be detected without that person's consent too.

In my opinion, this new technology is not valuable when it is used to read the emotions of students in a classroom setting. I do not think that it should ever be used on a student, child, or even an adult. If a person feels that he/she wants to share the emotions he/she is feeling then he/she will tell someone. All and all I 100% disagree with this new software.                   ";0
"Students after a long and rested summer break usually come back to school in August forgetting what they learned the previous year. To assure that students continue to learn over their break they should be able to make their own project instead of having a teacher designed project.

Summer projects should be student designed as it provides more creativity and freedom in their work, as well as it shows that they understand the given content by the teacher, but the project may not be easy to understand and complete compared to a teacher designed project.

A student designed project over Summer break creates creativity in the students because they would have to break their boundaries in order to discover what they need to create in their project. Students will also have more freedom because they will be able to chose their topics based on their own interest. This allows students to be excited to learn during their summer break; for example, if they are allow to choose what their project will be based about they will be more productive and continue to learn more as they will have an interest in their work unlike a teacher designed project that students might disagree on and become less productive to a topic that creates no satisfaction towards the students. That is terrible for the schools when students arrive back to school over break as they would not have learn as much because their topic was not interesting and maybe some would choose not to complete the teacher designed project because of the topic.

Allowing students to create their own project also visualizes that they understood their teacher content, by taking their teacher content and combining it to their own ideas into a project that shows the teacher that the students still remembers what they learn over summer break. While a teacher design project does not show if a student fully understand the content because every student will all have the same ideas and will be unable to show what new content they learned over the summer.

Because student gets to work on their interests which may be different then what they learn in their school year, they would have to do research to learn new topics that they never could have done with a teacher design project. A teacher project would not need to research new topics as they would just need to revise on what they learned over the school year. Thats why a student design project is better for learning for when they return back to school they would've had learned new content.

A teacher designed project is the least choice for a summer project. Although, it does have its own benefits such as being less stressful on students to work on this project because they will already know the basics and what to do for the project. They would be able to work together helping student understand the content more; for example, they would look over each other work making sure that they understand that they are doing the project correctly. Teacher designed project allows student to refresh and review what they learned during the school year over Summer break, that a student design project will be unable to accomplish due to the fact that teacher designed project is mainly about what they already learn instead of expanding into new topics.

In order to allow students to learn over their Summer break they would need student designed project to allow them to learn new things while also giving them more creativity that will help them out when they return to school. The student design allows for opportunity for the students to choose what they might want to do in the future and interest while a teacher design is not fully capable of doing the same. Allowing student designed project will help schools and student grow and learn while they are on break so that they don't come back to school forgetting main topics and having to waste time relearning such topics.";0
"Everyone needs a break from something they tend to stress about so they can get there stuff together. Meaning, if you keep pushing yourself to do something your having a hard time on you should take a break and do something you that will calm you down to help you. My principal says that students should attend any type of extracurricular avtivities. Such as art, sports, yearbook, and many more. I agree with my principal with his thought of choice.

Having fun classes can really help student when they start having a ruff time in school. Class is really stressful for me and others when they don't understand something at school. My happiness is soccer, art, and writing. Those 3 things help me so much. So when i'm strugling the only thing I think about is doing something I know that will keep my mind off of it and will start to calm me down. Art is one of the best class anyone can take. I say this because art, is litearlly art. You can do art out of anger, stress, sadness, and even happiness. Litearally out of anything. If your planning on doing a new sport in high school it can build your stress to even it to be better. I would have to wait all the way until i get home to play soccer, but in high school you will have a period so you can do that sport or activity. You should'nt be forced to keep doing your work without a break from being overwhelmed.

The more you practice the better you get. I understand when people say the more you study in school the more you understand. Thats not just for school work. It's also for these fun activities. Say you have never done a sport before, but want to start. You can do that in school and then when you sign up for the sport you want to do you will already be really really good, because all the practice you have got. Also, most people in middle school want to do a sport in high school. If you participate in that specific sport the coaches will see that you are really intrested in doing it. You can even do soemthing you never thought you would do, like Yearbok. Yearbok is a fun activityt and you can do a lot. The more you do it the best you get. That can be you new enjoyable hobby. No one ever knows what you can't do.

Although, students being allowed to do a fun class during learning hours can get them to lose the thought of there work. Students should focus on school work and schol work only. Especially for those who want a good career in the future. You can actually make a lot of money from art. Art is a easy activity you can do for your whole life, and it will also lead you to big things. The most important thing in my opinion is to do something that will get you somewhere ahead of life. Doing that will help you sucseed within your future. Anyting you enjoy doing as an activity can get you somehwere.

Extracurricular activities should be a new thing students at Hayfield should attend, and many more schools. I think that is a really good idea to allow for us students. No one should be stressed about someting that they need in life, what do you think?";0
"Hey there! 🎸🎶

So, you wanna know about my experience with music? 🤔 Well, let me tell ya, I've been totally into it since like, forever! 😅 I mean, I've always loved listening to different types of instruments and trying to figure out how they make that cool sound. 🎵 Like, have you ever heard a guitar solo and been like, ""Whoa, how did they do that?!"" 🤯

Anyway, in elementary school, I started playing the recorder and it was actually pretty fun! 🎶 I mean, it's not the most exciting instrument, but it's like, easy to learn and you can play simple songs with it. 🎵 Plus, it's like, really calming and stuff. 😌

But then, in middle school, I joined a chorus and started playing the xylophone! 🎹 It was like, totally different from the recorder, but in a good way! 😃 It's like, way more fun to play and you can make some really cool sounds with it. 🎶 Plus, it's like, super easy to learn too! 🎯

And then, I started playing percussion with my school band! 🥁 It's like, totally different from the xylophone, but in a good way! 😃 It's like, really fun to play and you can like, totally get into the music and stuff. 🎶 Plus, it's like, really cool to be in a band with your friends and play together! 🤩

But the best part is, I got to write and perform my own song for an important event! 🎵 It was like, totally nerve-wracking at first, but then I got into it and it was like, super fun! 😃 I mean, I wrote the lyrics and everything, and it was like, really meaningful to me. 💕 Plus, it was like, really cool to see everyone singing along and stuff! 🎶

"Taking an online course is becoming a popular option among students and working professionals alike due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. Online courses provide a flexible schedule that allows students to learn at their own pace and in their own time, thus making them ideal for those with full-time jobs or busy lifestyles. Furthermore, the cost of an online course is usually much lower than a seven-hour education course. 

However, one disadvantage of taking online courses is the lack of direct interaction with the instructor. As the course is delivered over the internet, it can be difficult to get immediate guidance and feedback. Additionally, students lack the classroom-based environment of a seven-hour education course which can limit their ability to collaborate and engage in group discussions with their peers.

Nevertheless, despite its drawbacks, taking online courses can still be a great route for learning new skills and advancing one’s knowledge. Online courses offer a wide range of subjects which are often updated to reflect the latest trends, providing students with the most up-to-date information. With these courses, students also have access to a plethora of digital resources such as video recordings and articles, as well as the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals from around the globe. 

In conclusion, both online courses and a seven-hour education course have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is ultimately up to the individual to decide which route best suits their needs and goals.";1
"Have you ever been in a situation where you have to make a hard choice and don't know what to do? There are many reasons why it is very important to ask for multiple opinions of advice. Some of the best reasons are because you get different points of view, you make better choices, and your choice doesn't reflect just one view.

The first reason I think it is important to ask for multiple opinions of advice is because you get different points of view. Sometimes one person's advice might not be the best choice for your situation. An example for this would be if you had to choose between going to a track meet or going to your sister's birthday party. If you get different points of view then it will help you make a well-rounded decision. Some people you ask might have been in a similar situation and have really good advice for which event to go to. Also if there are any people who have to choose between the 2 things too, ask them what they have decided on and why. All of these reasons will help you make a good decision.

The second reason I think that asking for multiple points of view is important is that you make better choices. If you just base your final decision off of what you think, you might regret it. Sometimes when you ask for advice, you realize things you never thought of. Like the example in the last paragraph, someone that you ask might remind you that it is your state track meet. This would greatly influence your final decision because that might be your most important meet of the season. This also helps you think about the long-term effect of your choice. How will this effect other people? How will this make me look? All of these things should be taken into consideration before making your final choice.

The final reason I think that asking for multiple opinions of advice is your choice doesn't reflect just one view. World leaders have to make choices all the time. Their choice needs to reflect the country's view. If the world leader made a choice based just on what he thought, then the country would probably get mad. If the leader asks for advice from co-workers or citizens then the country will be happy with the choice. The presidential election is a really good example of this because the electoral college has to choose the presidential nominee that the citizens want the most. If they just picked a random candidate then the country's citizens would be mad at the government. This method however of asking people for advice to make a better choice can be used for any situation big or small.

As you can see, asking for multiple views of advice can be very helpful in any situation. Just always remember to ask multiple people, make a decision that doesn't only reflect your point of view, and think about how your choice will effect other people involved. ";0
"Their are so many advantages of limiting car usage, for example having no car might even make someone happy, Heidrun Walter says ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Also driving cars can cause a lot of pollution, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the green house gas emissions in Europe. France had intense smog because of vehicles, it went 60 percent down after five days of no vehicle use.

Another benefit of no vehicle usage is instead of driving a car, you can go hiking, biking, skating , or take buses to your destination. ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. The day without cars has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the most of any other Latin American city. Parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city on the day without cars in Bogota.

Also, in the United States Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses. Instead of driving vehicles to work, one can carpool with a workmate. New York has a new bike sharing program anits skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect new priorities, aswell as car-sharing programs across the nation. Driving by young people decreased 23 percent as of 2001 to 2009.

Even though driving a car might get you to your destination quicker, it is better to go on a train, bike, skate, bus, taxi, carpool, or even walk because when you use a car too much you pollute the Earth. Biking, skating, and walking can also be fun sometimes, so stop driving a car and do something more alternative and less air pollutive, save the Earth.    ";0
"Attitude plays a crucial role in shaping our success, relationships, and overall well-being. It is the way we perceive and respond to situations and people around us, and it can have a significant impact on our lives. A positive attitude can lead to positive outcomes, while a negative attitude can have the opposite effect.

Attitude is a personal trait that can affect our behavior and interactions with others. When we have a positive attitude, we tend to approach challenges with optimism and resilience. This can help us overcome obstacles and achieve our goals. On the other hand, when we have a negative attitude, we tend to focus on the negatives and give up easily. This can lead to missed opportunities and a lack of motivation.

Attitude also has societal implications. A positive attitude can contribute to a more harmonious society, where people are more likely to work together and support each other. A negative attitude can create tension and conflict, where people are more likely to blame and criticize others.

It is important to note that our attitude is not always under our control. However, we can learn to manage our attitude and change it when necessary. One way to do this is by practicing gratitude and focusing on the positive aspects of our lives. We can also surround ourselves with positive people and avoid those with negative attitudes.

In conclusion, attitude plays a significant role in shaping our success, relationships, and overall well-being. A positive attitude can lead to positive outcomes, while a negative attitude can have the opposite effect. It is important to recognize the impact of attitude on our lives and take steps to manage it. By doing so, we can create a more positive and harmonious society for ourselves and others.";1
"picture this your just about to leave a long day of school, but then you remember you have to go play a sport that you dont even want to play , because you were forced in to it well that's what this principle wants to do. You should not be forced into anything you dont want to do its not fare. Who has the right to say I should and should not do with my free time. Plus it would put too much stress on the kids and you dont even know what in there free time, besides it's just unconstitutional to say all kids must do extra out-of-school work.

First off, you dont even know what kids do in there free time. Some kids skate,or cook you know hobbies and your taking there hobbies away from them. Most things you cant do in school like cook ,or skate and they would never get approved. some kids would prefer to skate than throw balls around. Some kids do chores or yard work when they get home, so if there not home to do them then it will never get done. Do you see the problem here if the chore dose not get done the house will look trashy. Im just saying some kids get exsersize by pushing lawn mowers. I myself gained most of my muscle from mowing lawns and walking to school

Second of all, this all can be very stressful. Keeping up with a sport and school can be very stressful. if you dont know working out and doing home work dont really match up too well. It can be stressful focusing on two things. It could even affect ones mental health . If a kid is not in the right mental head space and loose a lot it can make them feel depressed and make and them feel worthless. I mean teen suicide has been increasing over the years bet this example and a few more things like bulling could make a man go mad.

Its very unconstitutional to say some one must do something ,in this case make them do a after school activity. Its like taking ones amendments . Saying must is like communism your basically saying we dont have a choice. Kids should have a say in what they want to do with there life . Not every body wants to play a team sport ,some people find more enjoyment in solo games. If a kid dose not want to play in school who cares let him be. The constitution say that we can do any thing we want unless its harming people and hes saying I must do this that dose not sound very patriotic now dose it.

Some people might say ""kids need excersize"" well this is true for everyone and my response to that islet them dig there own path let them take life how they want if they just want to relax the entire time let them do that. Let them control there life let them enjoy it. If you want to take life one step at a time go head be you. Dont let some one tell you your to lazy.

I dont see the reasoning behind his idea . I should not be forced to do any extra work that i dont want to do. They dont know what I do in my free time I dont know what they do in their free time lets keep it that way. It would just stress the kids out and no one wants that . It's so unconstitutional he would probably get sent to jail if even proposed the idea. ";0
The new technology called Facial Action Coding System should should be used in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of the students. Why? you make ask. I belive it will actually rise the students smartness and test scores. Also it would be the best for years to come! It will hepl the students more smart becasue in classroom there are kids that are to scared/embrassed to rise their hand and ask questions. So if the teacher see a student is confused and sees that kid is to sacred to rise their hand then he would rexplain what he was teaching. Then if the technology shows he or she isnt confused then he would move on. This will be so great years to come because kids wouldn´t be left behind and wouldn´t feel that they have to drop out. If they will see their selfs being something big in the futer. Then we will have more doctors and mostly likely to find new medinces for illness like cancer. We will get sincetes to help us live in this earth longer and maybe hopefully keep the earth clean. They would be smart enugh to find new ways to keep the earth clean. Not even just to help the eart but help kids prevent from doing things that will harm themselfs and others. For an exmaple if the teacher sees somoene is so mad they can try to help and talk and that could help a school shooting because sometimes all we need to someone to talk to. So in conclusen i belive the new technology called Facial Action Coding System should be in the classroom because it will help the earth and thw world but mot imporantly us humans.;0
"Hi i am Luke. I have some reasons why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. When i first heard my friend ask me if i wanted to be a Seagoing Cowboy I did not know if I wanted to do it but once i found out what it was i thught it would be fun. When I got there and started doing what i was suppost to do I started enjoying it.

A reason I did is because I knew I was doing the right thing by helping with there community and just helping them with some little things also. Another reason is that when I went their I got to explore the acropolis in Greece and it was beautiful I think you would like it to. I also got a ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. I also went to china! It was very fun and so is being a Seagoing Cowboy. I also learned alot from it like we dont have to worry if we are going to get what we want for breakfast because some people that are less fortunate dont even have Three meals a day. It was hard to take that in but it deffinetly changed my whole point of view in life. I hope that if you give being a Seagoing Cowboy a shot that it would change your point of view in life also.

You should give it a try and see if you like it. If you do not like it you do not have to do it but if you do like it i suggest you do it more often, it is helping out and it is doing the right thing. So my point is that you should give being a Seagoing Cowboy a chance because it could defenitly make a change in this world. Thank you!";0
"If you where in World War 2 you would be scared and/or sad. If your house got destroyed and so did your farm it is ok if the Seagoing Cowboys where there. If you joined the Seagoing Cowboys you could help a lot of people and yourself. I strongly think that you should join Luke in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for boys. In order to join the Seagoing Cowboys program you had to be a boy. You where in the Seagoing Cowboys program for as long as you wanted but, the highest was 9 trips. They take care of all types of animals and you get to go all over the world and see many different things.

First thing you do is to go over the seas. Next you find where you need to go so you can go and help the area that have animals. Second you have to help people and animals by taking them to a safe place and trying to help them with everything you have. Lastly you go back to find more or go to a new place to help new people.

Helping is a good thing for all people but, you can also look around the places you are. For example, you get to go to Greece and help cargo 335 horses and all so look at the place. Lastly you could get many items to bring back to remind you of going and helping the people that need it the most and by going somewhere fun.

If you join the program then you get to meet many different people and try many new things. But, going only for fun is not the main reason. The main reason of going is to help people, animals, and other things. It is World War 2 at the time and many animals and people are trying to help them selfs but, they can't and that is why you should help them and join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

These are all my reasons talking about why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you joined this program you could help many people and also help yourself in many ways. I extreamly think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys in there adventures and having the experience of your life helping many people in need. Just remeber next time you hear someone lost ther barn or farm the Seagoing Cowboys will always help.";0
"Everyday you see kids participating in football, baseball, basketball, and other extracurricular activities, it is part of the balanced day for most kids. Extracurricular activities are important and enjoyed by most, but I believe children should not be forced to do activities like sports or clubs. Even though extracurricular activities are important they are hard for some to do. Many parents and kids nowadays don't have time for these activities with all the work and homework they have to do. Also some kids have disabilities or mental disabilities that cause problems when they are trying to do activities like football or yearbook club. In my opinion forcing extracurricular activities on kids is wrong because some parents and kids don't have time, and some kids with disabilities or mental disabilities might have trouble with rigorous activity.

In schools all across America kids have homework, it's unavoidable, children have to work hard no matter which school they go to. Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others. In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities. Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress. Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule. An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents. This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time.

In many American schools kids are burdened by a disability or mental disability. These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil. This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities. The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids. It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work. Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case. While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricular activities because of their underlying issues.

This is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lot of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities just don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong. I can't believe the principal is even considering doing this, but what do you think? Should extracurricular activities be required?     ";0
"There has been a major awareness of the effects that cars have on us as a means of transportation. People question whether or not abandoning cars as our primary use of transportation is worth the health of the environment. The simple answer to that is obvious, there would be no awareness, no statistics, no movements to prevent the use of cars, if there weren't any issue with them. Eliminating cars as our primary source of transportation is almost impossible, meaning that the solution to this fossil fuel emission problem must be an alternative source of energy. As technology has advanced, so has the mindset the majority of the modern society's population towards the issues of cars. Has the mindset of the population surpassed the advancement of technology, or have we been ignoring the fact that these fossil fuels emissions have been detrimental to our environment.

The one major thing that has caught everyone's attention is that the health of our environment being negatively impacted by the use of cars everyday. This is because this is the problem that should catch everyone's attention. People have this false notion that we wont see any environmental changes in our lifetime, so this means we dont have to worry  about this now. The problems that we predicted would occur have been occuring over the past few years. A prime example of this would be in Paris. Paris had been experiencing some weather problems. There was an abundance of smog that was filling the air, and diesel fuel was blamed. Paris enforced a partial driving ban as a solution to the smog problem. By eliminating cars as a use of tranpotation, some questions may occur. How will external delivery companies be able to deliver. By not being able to deliver, these companies will lose revenue, due to the fact that Paris has a partial ban on driving. Since this is most likely temporary, and a ""partial"" ban, this problem may be eliminated from the cons list of implementing this regulation. But a correlation occured. After the partial ban of driving, the smog dissapeared. This shows that by eliminating cars as a use of transportation this would have a significant effect on our harmed environment.

Another falacy that the majority of the population has is that the only problem facing the use of cars as the modern society's primary source of transportation is that cars harm the environment. Even though this is the problem that we all need to face now, there are other tedious things that come with the adoption of cars. Bogota, Columbia, has had extreme congestion, has created a movement that has been so successful it has spread to other countries. This movement involves the population abandoning their cars for one day and using any other possible means of transportation. This movement encourages the elimination of cars, physical fitness, and the elimination of traffic jams. The population of Bogota is so dedicated to this movement, that they have participated n this movement through bad weather conditions. This movement treats itself like a fundamental holiday to have every year. ""It' s a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""- Carlos Arturo Plaza (participant of the movement).

As you can see the process of eliminating cars as our primary source of transportation is a very difficult thing to accomplish. Bogota, Columbia's movement to abandon cars for one day is the closest the modern society has gotten to this. For this reason, there should be an alternate source of energy cars should run off of. By the environmental issues facing the use of cars, there have been many other problems that have sprouted because of the awareness that the modern society's citizen has now. Through the support of cars as the primary source of the modern population's transportation, there has been an abundance of users of cars. Since there was an overproductions of cars, seeing how this is the primary source of transpotation, statistics have occured showing the true dangers of the effects that the overuse of cars has on our environment. By implemeting an alternate source of energy that is not harmful to the environment, this would fix the majority of the problems. Instead we have been focusing on self-driving cars instead of cars that will be able to sustsain our environment before it's too late. A potential solution is energy efficiency, but the number one solution is awareness. Encouraging awareness is the one thing that can produce more potential solutions.    ";0
"Great opportunities for students to attend to classes from home by online way,

Well, Now a day with the new technology. Thinks get easy every day, Long time ago you had to attend to a regular school because there was no other way to attend to school and accomplish your career dream, But now we have new technologies that allow some school to give online classes from home, If you live far away from school and theres no way you can get to school faster and easily.

However, Some parents decided to enroll their children in a online school, Because they think thats better then to sent they to a regular school, In one point those parent are right because in a regular school you are not looking out their children, And they dont know what they are doing, Or even if they are in school or not, And also you dont know what class of friend does your child is hanging out with, Or if other children are bulling to your children,

In regular school you don't know whats going on,

But. by the other head in home school you can be with them during that time they dedicate to study, or even better if your schedule don't fit with the time they need to study, you can hire someone you have confidence with, To help you, In home school your child is not surround of bad children that can make your child feel depressed, So in this way you can see how your child is going in progress,

Then to come every day to regular school,       ";0
"The author supports the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it shows. In paragraph 2 the supports his claim by informing us that ""Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms- humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world"". Although no spacecrat survived the landing for more than a couple hours. This adds on to why in Paragraph 3 that, ""on the pantes surface, tempatres average over 800 degrees Farhrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". Another reason in paragraph 3 is that ""Venus has the hottest surface tempatre o any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"".

The author then supports his reasoning of Venus being worthy of exploring with an idea by NASA in paragraph 5 that despite the hostile planet conditions of the surface ""Venus would llow scientst to float above the fray"". the author explains to us a vehicle that will be able to hover 30 or so miles above Venus's hostile conditions. he also explains it as ""just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendl ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Even though tempatures would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the pressure would be similar to those at sea level of Earth, supported by solar energy. Altough the author does bring up insight that the vehicle will only have imited information, and it is just another challenge that many researcher are working on to innovate.";0
"I am for driverless cars, I believe they are the true future of vehicles. I think that cars where people still actually drive them will be used as entertainment than actual means of transportation. Traffic laws will of course have to be made for the driverless cars as time goes by, but I think that once they are fully driverless there will be little to no driving laws as the cars will be advanced enough to not have to worry about them. Cars may not be fully driverless in our lifetime, but I believe that eventually it will happen.

Traffic laws for vehicles will be added and removed as the advancement of driverless cars continue. I think that there will be motion sensors or a sync that will detect when a car is coming to a stop sign or a stop light and will make it stop on its own. All the basic driving laws of today will either be altered or removed more than likely.

Cars that are still required to have an actual person control them will be used more as entertainment purposes than for actual transportation. It will be like sporting events such as NASCAR and Formula 1 racing I would say. They will not be used for actual transportation though.

Cars will not be fully driverless in our lifetime, I believe. We will be very close to achieving it, however. I think that they will still be semi-driverless by then.         ";0
"Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.

As we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This may also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.

Our parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whether it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lot of money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.

When it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.

Extracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and can take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.";0
"Students should be told to do at least one extracurricular at school because doing an extracurricular can help students become more physically healthy, they can leave a lasting impression on their school and they can meet new people. All these can come from doing an extracurricular activity after school. I agree with this decision by the principal since most pupils will have good outcomes by doing an extracurricular activity. Students have a wide range of choices for their activity for example, students could choose to participate in sports such as baseball or basketball, work in the math club, the model U.N.

All the clubs you can think of the school most likely provides for their students to choose, however out of all the good reasons to force students to participate in these extra activities do have some setbacks. Some of these setbacks include the fact that maybe some students have responsibilities after school such as babysitting, jobs or religious reasons.

First, Students who choose to be apart of clubs such as the Student Government or National Junior Honor Society can revolutionize their school and create change in rules that they do not favor as much as other rules. These clubs usually encourage free thinkers and people who wanna to create change and revitalize their school when it gets a little stale and boring. Some kids might join a sports team or musical ensemble and win a championship or a musical trophy that the school can proudly display like all the other trophies that the school has won. Most schools are very proud of their pupil's accomplishments in or out of school usually displaying their accomplishments such as their students who went to the NBA like Kobe Bryant or became very famous actors like Tom Cruise.

Nelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the key to life and happiness"" and if that is true partially extracurricular can help you achieve that. As most colleges look at your application form they look at your Grades ACT and SAT but what they also look at is what extracurricular you are in such as clubs, sports teams or musical acts such as a band or ensemble.

Next, students can become more physically healthy and fit when doing some activities after school. The main example of that is a school sports team that the students can join like track or swimming can help them lead a healthy lifestyle and lose weight while filling their requirements to do a school extracurricular activity. These school sanctioned activities can help students become more fit and lose weight because of the sport. Sports in general are a good way to teach kids to be healthy and not sit at home all day and lay in bed or on a couch all day after school. Kids are easily impressionable to anything or anyone that tells them what they like such as a junk food commercial or a commercial for sugary cereal, these commercials tell them that the cereal that they are marketing is healthy but in reality it is just a sugary full of carbohydrates cereal. By letting kids stay after and teaching them what foods are healthy for them or not we can reduce the impact that childhood obesity has caused the last couple of years.

Lastly, most students who participate in after school activities can meet a lot of new people who are interested in the same things as you are and you can talk to them in the clubs or other activities you have joined. Most people who join clubs are often interested in the same things as everyone else in that club, there even some clubs just about certain interests such as the anime club which is just a club for kids who like anime or manga. Other clubs and extracurricular are also good places to meet new people if you are new to a school and need people to talk to.

these friends you make can become lifelong friends of yours even out of school and into college or the workforce and adulthood. These bonds that you make in middle school and high school can increase your social skills and help you with life skills like communication with other people, a skill needed in jobs like marketing where you most likely need to present in front of other people sometimes including your boss.

In conclusion, being told to do one extracurricular by your school isn't the end of the world you can make it fun by choosing a club or sport that you enjoy to do and it will not be a burden on you or your family. In these extra activities you can create a better you and show your school that, you can become healthier and you can always meet new people who share common interests with you. All the students are required to do an extracurricular most likely because the school just wants the best for you and your academic career whether that is from K-12 or beyond to college and the workforce extracurricular help you in many ways throughout your life, these clubs ensembles and teams can boost your self confidence, fortify your social skills while you have fun since you have chosen things that interest you and are not boring.";0
"How would you feel if you pulled up to a stoplight, and the person next to you was in the front seat, but wasn't driving? It would seem odd at first, but unfortuantely, there is a very good chance that that is the way things could be in the near future. Personally, I do not think that driverless cars should be invented. However, there are people that think that being able to go somewhere in a car without having to actually drive it would be a great idea. Driverless cars are not a good idea, because the cars may be more expensive since they are driverless, there could be malfunctions since the car would be made of new technology, and the people in the car would have to know when to be paying attention, in case of an emergency.

The first negative effect of having driverless cars, is the fact that the cars would probably be more expensive. Since the technology to make the cars would be expensive, the cars might be expensive themselves. If the cars are too expensive, no one would want to buy them unless they had a lot of money. Also, if not enough people are buying the cars, they might have to get discontinued eventually. If the cars had to get discontinued, everyone who already had one of those cars would be in hot water, becuase car repair people would not be able to fix their cars. This now leads me into my second reason why driverless cars should not be made.

What if the car has malfunctions? If there isn't an actual person driving the car, they won't be able to control the speed. The person will just have to trust the car to drive itself, and hope that it doesn't mess up, and accidently over accelerate and cause an accident. If the car did mess up while driving and caused an accident, someone would have to figure out whose fault it is. The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" made a good point by mentioning that if there is an accidnet, whose fault would it be - the driver or the company who made the car? There would defintiely be a big legal case to arise considering that the ""driver"" isn't technically driving the car.

The final reason that driverless cars should not be made, is because people would have to be able to learn to control the car. However, a positive thing about having driverless cars is that people would not need to take drivers ed anymore, but with a driverless car, you would still have to learn the ways of road. You would still need to be paying attention on the road. Just because your car would be driverless, doesn't mean that everyone's car would be driverless. For instance, if a wreck occured and you weren't paying attention in your driverless car, you wouldn't know whose fault it was, or if there was a way you could have stopped the wreck from happening. Going back to the text, the article mentions in paragraph seven that ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

To conclude, driverless cars should not be created. Driverless cars is a situation where the bad outweighs the good. There might be some positives to having a driverless car, but driverless cars seems to risky. With accidents happening, because people are not paying attention to their driverless car is not something I want to be involved in. Driverless cars are not the best idea, because they could possibly be more expensive than our regular cars, they could possibly have malfunctions to put the ""driver"" and others at risk, and the ""driver"" may not have to take drivers ed, but they would have to learn how to work their new car, which means that they would need to be paying attention. A driverless car is not something that I would invest in, but I could see them becoming popular in the near future.   ";0
"Many studies have shown that students that suffer from mental illness usually have bad attendance and do bad in school. As technology and social media has advanced throughout the years there has been an increase in online school and home school as an option. Many social media influences as well as athletes also do online or home school to the fact that they are doing other important activities and can still focus on school and graduate. Although attending classes from home it might not be for everyone it should still be an option for students. Having the option to go to class in the comfort of you're own house or computer can be dependent and benefiting on the lifestyle you have and personal preference on learning.

Sadly many young adolescents suffer and battle anxiety everyday and gets in the way of their learning. Not just anxiety but many other mental illnesses. For instance,In big schools and highly populated school social anxiety can be hard to cope in the way of you think everyone is looking at you and get really anti social .Speaking from personal experience from someone who is diagnosed with anxiety,my freshman year I had to present in big sized class and I started to get an anxiety attack,I got really red,started shaking,felt nauseous,began stuttering, and felt the whole room closing up. Probably one of the worst experiences ever and to this day whenever I need to present I hope I don't experience that again. Many students deal with this and with anxiety you don't know when its at its peek. Having an option to avoid this through being in your home can be benefiting for students and could probably increase grades.

Along with mental illness,the lifestyle you live such as being a social media influence or athlete. School is usually 8 hours and usually around two or three hours of homework each day. Social media influencers have a busy life such as promoting brand deals,traveling,collabing with other influencers,and going to brand events. Just like famous athletes need to train almost everyday and be focused by being recruited. With doing this at home it can help them worry about what they only need to get done and at their own pace. Everyone's life is different and although school is very important we can all agree that having an education is a top priority. You can loose fame any day or get injured and loose your skill in a sport but you will never loose your knowledge or education and no one can ever take that away.

There has been many arguments against the way the school system is messed up and how school isn't about learning as much just about passing. Everyone's brain takes in information different, some are kinetic learners or even visual ones. Point is,everyone learns different and at different pace. With online school you are in control of your classes and the pace you desire. Maybe some days you want to do five hours of school work and then another you only want to do two,its all your own preference and what you feel is your pace. Ultimately ,its how you feel is the best way you learn. Some might argue, with online school that students wouldn't experience the whole""high school"" experience such as prom,homecoming,football games,making friends,and even social skills. In reality,many schools offer the option of many of this with your zoned school. Luckily ,depending on your situation you can take some classes online and some at school .

Throughout the years ,online school has become more popular and easier for many students and helped improve their insights about school. Ultimately being in control of your education can help your grades. Not everyone learns the same and at the same pace. There are many restrictions with this not just in the U.S but globally and many older adults look at it in a bad way,in which it should not be. In conclusion,having the option of attending classes from your own home could be benefiting for the lifestyle they have,mental illness battling, and learning preference.";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm going to be straight and to the point, our students should be able to use their phones during free time and lunch periods, I do first agree that it has become a big enough problem to do something about the cell phones, but doing a way with them is not good idea it was already a rule not to use them during class, but they use them anyway what would a policy saying to never bring your phones to school do, we don't have the man power or time, or even rights to search them and no doubt a majority will still bring them anyway and disrupt class and their own learning, but if give them two times within the day when no learning is taking place to text or talk on the phone this will give time the time they need to get their socializing out before schooling.

If we give them some freedom they will come back and give us what we want, and in that case it's a winning situation for everyone. I can say myself I would learn better if this was the new policy Now if students disregard this new rule then disciplinary action goes as follows 1st time caught using device outside of free zones then a warning is issued, 2nd time and you get detention, 3rd time you lose the privilege for 9 weeks and detention, 4th will be decided by you the principal. If you go with the policy i have brought up, you will become more popular with the students and gain more respect giving you more lead into new rules you apply. it's said that if you give students more freedom of choice the can pay attention more and stay awake and alert during class. When students are distracted by these things like texting, talking on the phone they become distracted, and use food as a source of getting out of conversation or of being bored, which means more money will be spent on food, which is more money for the school.

The only non benefits i can think of from this plan is that students might still use their phones in class but discipline could take care of those problems, so the plan is almost flawless.";0
"At School

Students should not do school at home because it will put them in this bubble that will make the stay at home classes feel secluded and will make them become an introverted person. I do not think that doing school from home through videos would be very effective because at school you are surrounded by people who are or have taken the same classes that you are and it is easier for you to ask for help at a school with the teachers being there.

By going to an actual school you would be experiencing everything that someone who goes to a school would. You would be physically sitting in the same class with your classmates. You get to know your classmates, build friendships, and relationships with the people that you meet. You will get to know your teacher in person and get to physically ask them questions in person. If I did school from i would miss out on a lot because I would be by myself and I would have no friends in my class. I would also have to meet people from outside or from different events having to do with school.

Another reason to go to school is that by going to a school you gain so many things, one of them being skills. Some skills that you gain would be communication skills. Being able to communicate is really important; not just in school but outside in the real world too.

At school you have to do projects, talk to classmates about school work or about school in general. later, after school the kids who did school from home our most likely going to go to a college where they don't offer the same things by providing video conferences and other things having to do with doing school online. They are not going to be used to being in the same room learning the same things with multiple people. For the kids who did go to school, it won't be a big transition for them because going to college will be the same as going to a high school. The only difference is that college is a higher level course and you have to start over and meet new people.

Some people may argue that learning from home is more effective and beneficial because it takes away distractions and it will help their kid become more independent. However, I still think that going to school is more beneficial because being at a school, you are surrounded by people who have taken the same classes and your teachers will be there physically so that you can ask them questions and build friendships with them and your classmates. You can also become an independent person at school because you have to be able to speak up for yourself, ask for help. Me, going to a school i have to become independent now that i'm growing up. I have to ask for help and be able to do things on my own.

Going to school is a great way to get to know a lot of people that you might not meet by random. A school offers a lot of different things, such as clubs, volunteer opportunities, and the chance to be on a sports team. If you did school from home you'd have to get permission and would have to do have your grades be good enough to participate. At home you are reliable for understanding the information that you are receiving from the videos and if you have a question you have to email or get a tutor because sometimes the teacher isn't available and you'd have to go off the notes you took and the videos that are available to you online. Therefore, going to a school is more beneficial because it has more opportunities to offer you and people to learn from in one building. ";0
"Poof! Cars are starting to disappear. Many cities and countries are prohibiting car use, they feel it would be drop pollution rates. Your probably thinking right now; this is crazy, who would ban cars? Just think about it there are many advantages to not having a car. First, you wouldn'nt have to worry about gas, theres no need to buy gas if you dont have a car. Second, you'll become healthier. Third, more interraction with the world.

All the money you spend on gas.. what a shame! If we didn't have cars you'd have more money, imagine what you would do with all that money. Maybe a nicer house or maybe a nice big pool in the backyard, you'd never know unless you give it a try. I know what your thinking how would I get to work or how would I get to the doctors; they're would still be public transportation to get you to important places.

If there were no cars, many people would be a lot healthier. Not just people, the environment would be a much healthier places. Polution rates go down, less asthma attacks, more fun, no honking, no worrying about wether the kids are alright to be outside by themselves; sounds good to me. There would also be more family bonding, go for nice walks to the park or beach.

Imagine your walking down the street, you know everyone, you stop and talk, maybe laugh. That's what it'd be like with no cars. Not one face on the street that you didn't know. Many gatherings with friends, many laughs, a lot of fun it sounds like.

The car culture is starting to end in many countries and cities including the United States of America. No cars sounds nice, yes maybe you you think there would be many poor effects on the culture but you also have to look at the bright side. More money, you'd become healthier, and you'd have more interractions with world.                          ";0
"The author states this FACS machine can read emotions just by looking at someone is non-sense but this could be true. It decoded the facial emotions of the Mona Lisa and saying all her emotions just by looking at it, i wan't to beleive it can do that.

The author states that Mona Lisa is "" 83 percent happy, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The algerithym only gave us 91% of the Mona Lisa emotion what about the other 9%? The FACS machine reads your 44 major muscles to read your emotions which is amazing and kind of silly at the same time. This all the machine does but it could be helpful to figure out if someone is really upset about something going on, but it could have some draw backs to it. The FACS machine only read 91% of the Mona Lisa and i want to know the rest of it!

The positive aspect of the machine is that it could read emotions and facial muscles to see if the kid is thinking about suicide if it could do that. The FACS machine ""using video imagery, the new emotion-recognizer software tracks these facial movements."" This shows that FACS is devolping that one day could helps with emotions and other various life problems like helping us recognize friends that are going through a rough patch in their life. These sentences from the text "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actully describing each facial trait the conveys happy, worried etc."" If Dr. Huang devolps the FACS machine more to helps more with friends emotion when feeling down or even our parents if neccesary. This could have a huge impact for students because teachers can with problems in your just by recognizing your facial movements and emotions.

This FACS machine may have some down sides to it because this could be a invadement of personal space, say if some doesn't want to talk and use this machine to do so then you used the machine without that persons permission so this machine as long as it used for people that really need the help i don't think this machine will last much. This text from the passage ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, "" Dr. Huang. "" So computars need to understand that,too."" Another upside to this FACS machine is that it could become a human inscrutor "" A classroom computar could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effecttive human instructor.""

The FACS machine could be a huge help with students that struggle emotionaly with anything, so for final conclsuion the FACS machine can a huge help to students but also be a invasion of personal space, because some students don't know that their computars have this program and reads their emotions without them knowing ahead of time. This FACS machine should be installed if the students want it to be installed.";0
"Cars can change the universe

Fellow citizens there should be a limit on car usage . If there's limits with our car usage then we would have a better community, there would be less pollution,less drugs passing through other citizens cars. If there isn't a limit on car usage us citizens would be the ones suffering from chemicals getting into our  lungs from all the pollution our own cars let out, two we would be affecting our community because everyone wouldn't walk anywhere they'd just spend money on gas going to somewhere or visting there friends and family . Better to save the earth, then to damage the earth.

First, why not just have limits on car usage saves our community just by a little step like that. We wouldnt have to worry about just walking down the street and a drunk driver just coming out of no where and hitting us. In source 1, by Elisabeth Rosenthal in interview a mother of two and she said, ""When I had a car I was always tense."" why be tense when you can be stress-free just by not using your cars all the time and having limits on them. If we actually do help our community by having limits on our car usage then we could make cities denser,and healthier community to walk around in.

Second, pollution sucks, these chemicals we're observing are eventually going to hurt us in the long run we are either going to die of the gas our cars are releasing or we're either going to get really sick from it. Who wants to get sick because a stupid decision of driving a car? most definetly not me. These limits are for the best for us citizens . Like source 3, by Andrew Selsky States ,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air .""of course its better to just take a nice walk than to just be lazy and drive a car. Bike rides with friends sound better than a car ride, in a car people usually blast the music and don't communicate with one another, but while you bike ride you can communicate with one another and actually have fun racing eachother on these bike rides healthier than a car ride.

Last, with the limits of car usage smoggling can be prevented because it won't be easy for people from other countries trying to pass by in cars with drugs because the state would have certain transportations they can only use which they might not want to use because it's so public. Source 2 states, last week, Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter(pm) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,his only means someone from another country brought it to Paris and its ended up at London who knows how.

It's better of just having car usage limits to prevent drug passing, also to help our community, and have a healthier earth without pulluting the eart.    ";0
"Some people believe in different things such as aliens for example, but what about you?

We all heard about the ""face on Mars"" some might say it's real or others say is it NASA playing a trick on us? But it all started falling into place when we got some news about it.

I believe that this is real. No not the alien part but the face it's was fomred by natural landforms. Land forms can be created at any given moment - but this certain one just seemd to catch someone's eyes.

So on April 5, 1998 Michael and his Mars Orbiter camera took a shot of the ""face"" that made it look 10 times bigger than it was the viewers were shocked. Just as NASA revealed that it was only a natural land form. Some people weren't satisified just yet... they needed more information or did they want more to sound right?

So for quite awhile the argrument grew bigger on the big question "" Did aliens really make this?"" No one wanted to believe NASA because, they thought they knew more stuff than they were telling people. Maybe they wanted it to be something bigger or something better.....           ";0
"Dear Principal,

I think changing the school policy so that students have to have a grade B average is not really necessary because some kids that have a grade C average could be like one point or two points away from having a B average and they could be one of the better players on the team. Even the whole team or most of them could have a C average so if they couldn't play the team would have to forfeit the game and that could be the game to go to the state play-offs. Some of the kids parents and even the rest of the school not playing sports mite not like that the team had to forfeit the game to go to the state play-offs. So if the principal decides to change the school policy so that the students have to have a B average then he is going to have a lot of angry parents and a lot of angry students blaming him that they couldn't go to the state championship when they would have a chance to win the trophy and even possibly get medals for winning the state play-offs. They would miss getting a picture of them winning it and they could put it in there trophy case beside the trophy.            ";0
"Today, I will be discussing why to join the Seagoing Cowboys program and participate in the program. This essay will talk about how you can visit many different places and how it can change your life. Those are my 2 main points that I will be discussing in this essay.

This paragraph will discuss on how you can visit places and learn things. This is great opportunity to go visit unique places. First, when you go and visit you can go learn new things and you can see the world the world better. Secondly, it can make you change the way you see the world. You can also experience new adventures. If you were to go see Acropolis it would suprise you and traveling can probably give you experience to the world. This paragraph was about how you visit places and about how you can learn things.

This paragraph will talk about how it can change your life. In the passage, it says it opened up the world to him and that it was great opportunity. If you were to join the program it would make see the world better and change your life. It can help treat the world better and you can help people. Helping is big part on changing your life. It can make you more aware of people in need that need help. This paragraph was about how it can change your life.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of the impact of extracurricular activities on a student's educational experience:

Hey there, folks! Today we're gonna talk about something super important: extracurricular activities! You know, like sports, clubs, and volunteering. They're like, totally awesome and stuff, but can they actually help you do better in school? Like, for real? That's what I wanna find out.

So, I did some research and talked to some of my friends, and here's what I found out. Some students, like, totally rock at balancing their extracurriculars with their schoolwork. They're like, super organized and stuff, and they make sure they don't miss any classes or fall behind on their homework. They're like, totally committed to both, and it shows! They get good grades, they're involved in their communities, and they're just overall super happy and successful.

But, on the other hand, there are some students who are like, totally struggling to balance their extracurriculars and schoolwork. They might join a ton of clubs and sports, but then they start to fall behind on their schoolwork and miss classes. They're like, totally stressed out and overwhelmed, and it's affecting their grades big time. They might even get in trouble with their teachers or get kicked off the team or club. That's no fun!

So, what can we do about it? Well, I think it's important to find a balance. Like, you should totally do extracurriculars and stuff, but you also gotta make sure you're not neglecting your schoolwork. Maybe set aside some time each day to catch up on your homework or talk to a teacher if you're having trouble. And don't join too many things at once! You gotta pace yourself and make sure you can handle it.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities can totally have a positive impact on a student's educational experience, but you gotta be careful and make sure you're not overdoing it. Find a balance, stay organized, and you'll be golden! Or,";1
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it was talking about Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is actually a planet it has a nickname called Evening Star.

Venus is the second planet from our sun often referred to as Earth twin. Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too. They are trying to land a spaceship on Venus its been three decades that a spaceship has landed on Venus. Its becoues the on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. They are studying Venus becoues long ago Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. Venus has rocky sediment and includes familier features such as valleys, mountains,and craters. NASA is trying to send men up to Venus to studying it but they are trying to bulid something that hovers over Venus and they can studyng it. NASA is working on other approaches to studyng Venus.

Venus is a planet to know about becoues that might be the next planet we might be living on. I think its a good thing to study on Venus becoues its a planet that might be closes to ours.";0
"I believe studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky, its reffered to as Earth's ""twin"", and this planet is so inhospitable that a spacecraft couldn't survive a landing for more than a few hours. In this passage it explains all of the faults of a planet so close to us. The planet Venus, has weather issues and is one of the brightest points in our solar system. Although it can seem dangerous to even want to explore this planet, it has its reasons why it should be explored.

This planet is a planet NASA has attempted to explore. Due to the conditions of Venus they have failed to learn very much. It has been 30 years since a spaceship has touched down on venus. In paragraph 3, it states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" It then goes on to explain the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are not suitible for humans on Earth. With these issues, scienticts are still ready to know more about this planet. The author shows even though the planet has many faults, these are the things scientists need to discover and understand.

Venus is often reffered to as our planet Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest to our is density and size. In paragraph 4, the author says Venus is the most Earth like planet. They believe Venus was covered with oceans and could have supported forms of life as Earth is able to. Venus also has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes on its surface. The weather on Venus is similar to some of the weather we get on Earth. Scientists want to see how many more similarities Venus has with Earth. Venus could also have a species more capable of their contitions.

Venus is also one of the brightest points of light in our night sky. ""Evening Star,"" which is another nickname for Venus, makes it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus being one of the planets closest to us and one of the few planets almost anyone cansee even from home makes it easier and easier to find reasons that scientists feel the need to explore such places. My own classmate herself once told me ""We need to start learning more about Venus. It could mean so much to have knowledge of our sister planet.""

I believe studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, Venus is one of th brightest points in the sky, it is reffered to as Earth's ""twin,"" and this planet is so inhospital that a spacecraft could'nt survive a landing for more than a few hours. In the passage, the author shows evidence to support their reasons as to why Venus has value. All the reasons listed show how Venus can be of value to scientists. It is important for the scientists to understand why the weather is the way it is and how similar Venus is to Earth. We could live there or we could meet a new species. Knowing everything about Venus could benifit and change so much about science today!    ";0
"Everyone has those people whose opinions they value the most. Your parents, siblings, friends, teachers, maybe even your favorite celebrity. They are your influences: the people you want to be like. You see their simple decisions and life decisions and want to be making the same ones at some point. You want their habits and lifestyle. However, you probably don't look up to just one person. you probably have multiple people in your life who influence you. So, when it comes to the advice that you need for yourself, you're going to want to hear from a couple different people. Everyone has different experiences with almost everything in life and the more you hear, the more and better perspectives you get because you will hear something a little different from everyone.

let's start with something simple, such as a math problem. You've learned a new concept in algebra today and it didn't really make sense to you. You're confused with your homework and you are sitting at the kitchen table with your dad.(surely you've had this experience before). He starts introducing the subject to you with a completely different outlook than you remember in class. This brings you a little farther, but not far enough, so you turn to an older sibling or your mom, and they might explain it a little better. After that, you watch a video on Kahn Academy and that ties it all together. Suddenly, it all makes sense to you, and because you also had help from all sorts of other people, you get this full understanding because you know several different ways to solve and you know how they all work in the problem.

Maybe you're seeking advice in style. Let's say you want to design your own home. The first people that you would go to would be people with the experience of remodeling or rebuilding their house. These people will lead you to their favorite architect and show you the wood flooring and counter top material they used. They'll know what to do and what not to based on their experience. After that, you tell your other friends about it and one of them gives you the idea to build a passive house! you put research into it and you fall in love with the idea of having one. All of these ideas help you make ultimate decisions and design your dream home.

It's always best to hear from multiple people. All their opinions and similar experiences will add up to your best choice. Later, your ultimate choice might help someone else. It's all a cycle. The more input, the better!";0
"Phones & Driving :

In my opinion I think we shouldn't you cell phones while driving, because that causes lots of accidents. This has become the number 1 distraction for people. Most teens have road rage , and that is a bad feeling to have while behind the wheel.

Teens swear they can multitask , no they can't that's why you should always focus on the road.

There are lots of ways you can use your phone though.

If you connect your phone to your car then, you will be good. Most teens like to buck and do what they want to do , and that's how consequences come in. That is why a lot of accident be occurring so much, you guys be hurt so bad. There is always for teens getting hurt and dying because they wanted to have they phone and be on it while driving.

You shouldn't want to text and drive anyways.

It doesn't take that long to hit someone soon as you look down or anything like that.

There are reasons why is shouldn't text while drive . The phone will take your eyes off the road for a long time, and

Teens like they can do it but they can't safety first.

You will loose all of your focus towards your cellphone.

You will be sitting at the light for a while thanks to your phone. People will beep their horn and you will get a attitude.

We as young people, we think everybody is disrespecting us, but we be in the wrong cause we be on them cellphones while trying to drive. There has been a lot of teens dying than adults ,because of these cellular devices.

I'm not gone lie, some teens do know how to text and drive. They know how to Multi-task and everything. Some teens know when to get on that phone and when not to . For Example, you at a red light you can take a look at your phone, and do what you have to do . When that light turn green put your phone down, and continue driving . Some teens want to get on the phone no that is not a good idea.

In Conclusion, Texting and Driving is the number one distraction for us young people. I want to inform young people that it's a lot of consequences that come with this distraction. My opinion to teens Is please stay off your phones while driving, these phones is that a good reason to lose your life. Cellphones are big distraction to us on the road. We need to banish phones when we are on the road , we should be able to make it to our distination very safe and sound.                                                    ";0
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Working alone versus working in a group, which is better? This is a question that has been debated for a long time. In English class, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages.

Working alone has some pros. For one, it's easier to focus when you're by yourself. You can take your time to think about what you want to say and make sure your ideas are clear. It's also better for when you're working on a project that requires a lot of creativity, like writing a story or poem. When you're alone, you can let your imagination run wild and come up with something really cool.

But there are also some cons to working alone. Sometimes it's hard to come up with ideas when you're by yourself. You might feel stuck or like you're not good enough to come up with something great. And if you make a mistake, it's harder to fix it when you're alone. You have to start over from scratch, which can be frustrating.

Working in a group, on the other hand, has its own set of pros and cons. One of the best things about working in a group is that you can bounce ideas off of each other. You can come up with something really great together that you wouldn't have thought of on your own. It's also easier to divide up tasks and work on different parts of a project. For example, one person can work on the introduction, while another works on the conclusion.

But there are also some cons to working in a group. Sometimes it's hard to agree on what to do or how to do it. You might have different ideas and opinions, which can lead to conflicts. And if someone isn't pulling their weight, it can be hard to get the project done on time.

In conclusion, working alone and working in a group both have their advantages and disadvantages. It really depends on what you're working on and what kind of person you are. If you're creative and like to work on your own, then working alone might be best for you. But if you like to bounce ideas off of other people and work together, then working in a group";1
"A face on mars! NASA found a face on mars that is said to be a natural landform but many think it is alien creation. There are many reasons that shows that claim of it being an alien creation is false for example there have been 3 pictures of the ""face"" the face looks different in each, it is a lava dome, and there is not a reason for NASA to keep it a secret.

In the article they give 3 pictures to look at and in each one the landform looks a little different because of the new advance technology. For example the picture in 1976 yes it does look like a face but that could be just because of the low camera quality at the time of the picture taken. The picture could've been anything at the time a rock formation is and was the logical explanation for this. For example in the second picture taken in 1998 the landform is a little blurry but easier to see and in this picture it doesnt resemble a face at all it was revealed to be a natural landform. The example shows that NASA confirmed that it is just a natural landform and is not an alien creation. It does not even look like a face in the sharper picture take in 1998. The last example is the picture taken in 2001. Many thought that the picture taken in 1998 was not proving anything because it would have been winter in mars so the picture had to be taken through wispy clouds so they went again in 2001 they went on a cloudless summer day. For example in the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extra ordinary photo using the camera's absoulte maximum resolution."" The example shows that NASA took an amazing clear photo revealing that it is just a land form.

In the article there are three different missions. In the first mission they fiqures it was just another common Martian mesa. For example in the text it says,"" Scientist fiqured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows."" The example shows that they said that it is just mesa with unusual shadows. The next mission sais that it is indeed a natural landform. For example in the story it says,""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial viking photos and posted on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform."" The example shows that the new cameras showed that it was just a landform but that still wasnt enough evidence to some. The third mission was in 2001. For example in the text it says,"" a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" The example shows that this mission was on a cloudless day so there would be nothing blocking the view of the landform. All three missions they all agreed it was just a natural landform

Why would NASA want to hide it and there is enough evidence that it is just a natural landform There would be no reason to ""hide"" if aliens were found. For example in the text it says,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" The example shows that if there was a civilzation they would not keep it a secreat because they could get more money to study it and in the long run more money for discovering it. Another example is in the story it says,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes ont he ground or Eqyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The example shows that if there was ancient civilization there they had to live somewhere and we would be able to see their shacks. The last example is in the story it says,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The example shows that it is a butte or mesa and it even looks like the middle butte in the River. There is no way the ""face"" is anything but rocks.

In conclusion there is no evidence what so ever that the landform is an alien creation. There was though 3 missions that have evidence showing that it is a landform, there were three different pictures,and there was no reason for NASA to hide this dicovery. The ""face"" is just a natural landform. ";0
"The more people you ask the more it will help you as a person. When getting advice, I believe the more opinions you get the better. It is good to ask many people because, you can get better advice, you can also get different points of view, and you can decide on what the best decision is. I agree with asking multiple people for advice because, it only benefits you, and there are almost no cons. When you are in need, and desperate for help, asking many people for advice is the best thing to do.

The more people you ask for advice, the better answers you will get, and you will be able choose what's best for you. It is good to get the best advice you can because, it will help you and the situation you're in. Once you know who gives the best advice, if you have a problem down the road, then you can ask that same person for advice. When you get good advice, you will be able to adapt to those kind of situations, and you will know what to do in future situations. It is definantly worth it to just ask a few more people of their opinion.

When you are asking many people for advice you are guaranteed to get different points of view. When you get different points of view, you will be able to look at your situation in a different way. When you see things from a different point of view you will be able to see what is happening on your side of the situation, and the other side of the situation. When you can see all sides of the situation you may realize that some people have it worse than you do, and you should be grateful for what you have. When someone gives you a different way to look at things, it can really change who you are as a person.

When you ask many people for advice and you know what is best, and how to look at the situation, you will come to realize what the best decision is to make in your circumstances. Although what you may have to do is hard, it will help you in the long run. By making only one decision, it could lead you to success in the future. Once you have been able to figure out what decision is best, eventually you will be a good decision maker and may not need advice from others. Make sure when everything is going through your head, that you believe the decision you made was best.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice can help you tremendously. Not only will it help you in the present, but it will also help you in the future. Just asking a few more people will help you get better advice, teach you how to look at things with a different point of view, and to become a good decision maker. It will help you and lead to success in many ways you dont expect. Asking those few extra people for their opinion is so worth it.";0
"""What?! That's crazy talk!"" Generic_Name screamed in shock as she walked away from Generic_Name. ""I asked her for advice, It's unbelievable that she would even think I would do that,"" Generic_Name said under her breath while she dialed another one of her friend's number to ask her for advice instead. The friend she called, Generic_Name, picked up the phone and Generic_Name began to ask her for advice. ""I get it, I've been in that same situation before,"" Generic_Name responded. Generic_Name stayed on the phone with Generic_Name fr over an hour giving her advice. After the long phone called filled with meaningful conversations, Generic_Name was satisfied with Generic_Name's advice. It was probably the best advice she had ever heard, ""Thank you so much, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said with a smile as she hung up the phone. Asking more than one person for advice is better than only asking one person because, there may be someone who has been in the same situation, the person in need of advice may completely disagree with someone's advice, and better advice will be found with the more people who are asked.

To begin, asking more than one person for advice is better than only asking one person because, there is always someone who has been in the same situation. When someone that shares the same experience is asked for advice, they'll probably give the best advice to someone about the situation. They'll usually know what's best to do since they've been through the same thing. So, people who share that experience are definitely the best ones to ask for advice unless, the person in need of advice isn't satisfied with it. If they're still not satisfied, they can ask more people, which is another reason why it's always smarter to ask more than one person for advice.

Disagreeing with someone's advice is another reason why asking more than one person is smarter. If only one person is asked for advice, it'll seem as if following their advice is the only way to go. For example, if two girls stopped being friends because of a slight misunderstanding and one of the girls asks someone for advice. The advice they're given may be to avoid her, even though they may not like it, they're most likely going to do it. If the girl asks more than one person for advice and the other one says to work the problems out, the girl will have choices and she won't be forced to do something she doesn't want to do.

Another reason why asking more than one person is more effective than only asking one is, better advice will be found with the more people who are asked. If over three people are asked for advice than it'll be less stressful making a choice. Having many options to choose from is way better than only having one choice. As more people are asked, the advice they share may get better and better. Only asking one person limits you to one choice you may not even like. Someone will share the advice they want to hear and making the choice will be easy.

In conclusion, asking more than one person for advice is better than only asking one. Asking more than one person for advice will make it easier to choose good advice to follow. With the more people that are asked for adivce, a good choice will be found. Also, asking more than one person will prevent people from being pressured to do something they don't want to do. Asking more than one person is always best.";0
"WHY DO WE HAVE TO!!!

My position on this matter is that not everyone likes sports, doing yearbooks, or serving on student council. some students would like to just go to school do their work get a grade and go home.

Students dont really like doing extracurricular activities. Some just like to get in trouble or do their work and go home.

Some students dont really know what they want to be in life. Some just make up something they want to be but, dont put out any effort in trying to achieve that goal. So honestly the principal should not say you must/ have to join a extracurricular activity , because what if you join and you end up getting injured then it would be the principals conscience because he/she made you join the sports team, or what if you break a wrist, or a arm then you can not type the yearbook, or what is you dont like political stuff but they make you sign up for it.

The principal would have to think about what the students like also. He/she can not just make anyone join anything if they dont wan t to join. The parents of the students would be upset if their child came home everyday saying ""I dont like what activity they made me do"" then the principal would feel some type of way because then he would be getting complaints from parents saying I want my son/daughter out of that activity.

The principal needs to think about everyone else's feelings and not just his own.";0
"The Seagoing Cowboys program was I great, and I suggest that everyone try it. If you like animals this would be a good job for you, if you like sailing it would be a good job for you, and most of all is you need something to do and would enjoy sailing with animals this is the perfect thing for you.

To join the Seagoing cowboys you don't even have to be qualified, infact I didn't even know about it until my friend asked me if I wanted to come. My friend Don Reist invited my to travel to Europe on a cattle boat. So, really you don't need a big flashy degree or really anything at all to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you love animals you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. As a Seagoing Cowboy you get to spend a lot of time with a lot of animals. The day the Pacific war ended I set out on my first trip, which was to Greece with 335 horses, and if you like spending a lot of time with animals, it takes two weeks to cross the pacific, and to go to China it'll take a month. So, if you enjoy to spend time with animals you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to have a lot of fun and do a lot of site-seeing. As a Seagoing Cowboy I always found a way to have fun. We would have baseball and volleyball games, we would have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, we would even enjoy boxing, reading, and even whittling. And to top it all off we saw a lot of amazing sites. We would go all over Europe and China. I have personally visited Greece, China, seen the Panama Canal, and have even toured an excavated castle in Crete. Even though there might be long excruciating trips, we still find ways to have fun.

There are many upsides of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I have only told you a few of the many, many advantages of being a Seagoing Cowboy. So, after all of this I hope you consider joining me on the high seas. ";0
"Dear Principal,

I think you should consider enforcing policy number 1. Policy number one is better for the school because if you would just let kids use their cell phones and other electronics, more students would probably pay more attention in class.

Instead of trying to text their friends in class because they cant text them at nutrition or lunch, or trying to listen to their IPODS because they can listen to it at nutrition or lunch, if you enforce policy number 1.

If us as students realize the rules your making are sort of unfair because sometimes teachers use their phone in and out of class and we don't get to use our cell phones (that's a little hypocritical), and if we think the rules are unfair were obviously not going to listen to them and make our own rules and have or make our own freedom.

So i ask as a fellow student , as an eighth grader for you to choose policy number 1, because if you choose policy number more students will pay more attention in class, learn more, get better grades, also as eighth graders you will have helped us make our last year here way better than it was going to be, and would have given us our freedom, and your trust.

That is why you should choose policy Number 1.";0
"There are schools that sometimes encourage or require teachers to assign a project over summer break. This is beneficial because it keeps the student actively learning. Sometimes when students come back after having a long period of break, and if they did not kept actively learning, it can be difficult to get back on track. If schools were to assign summer projects for the students, I think that it would be more beneficial for the project to be student-designed, because students have more control over the level of difficulty, more creativeness, and it can motivate them to do it.

When students have more control over the level of difficulty, they can decide how challenging the project should be. There are times when teachers have handed out activities, projects, or classwork where they can be a bit too challenging or stressful for some students. For example, I was once given an assignment in history, where I had to research a topic and then write five pages maximum. This was hard for me, because it was a big jump as to what I would usually write, and over time it just ended up stressing me and I felt as if I really did not gain much information out of it. However, when in another class we were given a year-long project that was student-designed, I learned so much more and had a better experience. Even though we did also make the project challenging, it was not too overwhelming for al. We had a better opinion as to how much we were capable of without it becoming overwhelming and stressful. When students decide how challenging the project should be for them, it can help them learn better and actually apply the new learned knowledge, compared to when teachers decide.

If projects were student-designed, the students have a better chance of being more creative and expressing better. Nobody really likes to do tasks that are boring for them, or where their creativity is tight. I once had a science project where I was allowed to be creative, and since that was the case I not only learned and understood the information better, but my grade improved as well. There are many times, that I have proved that when the projects were created by the students, students learned much more because they liked it and they could express themselves better. Sometimes when teachers limit their students, it can become very stressful an unpleasant for the students. Not many can successfully learn and grow in an environment like that.

Summer break is supposed to be fun vacations and a stress-free time period; yet, it students should still be actively learning during the break. However, if projects are assigned, then students should be allowed to create them themselves in order to make them more fun. When projects, or even simple task can be made in a fun way, it can be less stressful and more enjoyable. That way, many more students would be more motivated to actually do the project and put effort into it. When there is motivation, and things are done thoroughly, the ending results tend to reflect that. For example, when students have to study for a test, and they are given study guides with just questions it really does not help motivate some students to study. Unlike when students who use different study tools, such as games or more interactive activities, this makes the task more fun and wanting to put effort.

When projects are fun and more creative, students can learn, understand, and apply the information better. Learning over the break can also be helpful so when returning back to school, they have retained the old information, yet have learned new one too. I think that projects that are student-designed are more successful than teacher-designed projects, because students can decide the level of difficulty fit for them, there is more creativeness, and it can be more effective and motivational. ";0
"Dear State Senator,

I'm aware that there are two ways of electing the president of the United States. According to Source 1 ""What is the Electoral College?"", the Electoral College is a process where electors get elected to vote for President and Vice President. The other option is popular vote. Popular vote is when the people vote, and which ever Candidate gets the most votes wins the election. I personally feel that you should not keep the Electoral College. In my opinion, election by popular vote is a better strategy of electing the President and Vice President of the United States. Electoral College is a horrible strategy, because voters are not actually voting for the President, they are voting for a slate of electors. There are other reasons why I believe that popular vote is a more accurate way of electing the President and Vice President of the United States.

Under the Electoral College system, voters don't actually get to vote for the President, and Vice President. According to Source 2 ""What's wrong with the electoral college?"", the voters vote for a slate of electors who will elect the President. It's possible that the voters may not even know much about the electors that will be electing the President. The electors can be anyone, it depends on what state you are in. According to Source 2 ""What's wrong with the electoral college?"", sometimes the electors may be elected by state conventions, the state party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't even control who their electors vote for sometimes. What if voters choose an elector, and the elector doesn't even vote for the President that the voter was hoping they will vote for? That seems unfair to me, because during this process, there's a chance that the voter may not even get to actually vote for the candidate that they wanted to vote for.

This is why I feel that popular vote is more accurate. Voters get to vote for the candidate that they want to win to be the President, and know that their vote will count. They don't have to worry about electing an elector that can possibly vote for a different candidate. So, may you please consider removing the Electoral College, and replacing it with popular vote?. I'm sure it will make many voters happy that their vote will actually count, and that they will not have to vote for an elector.            ";0
"Hey, ya'll! So, I know we've been talking about this in class, but I really want to dive deeper into the benefits of seeking multiple opinions from different people. Like, it's super important to get other people's perspectives, ya know?

First of all, it helps you broaden your horizons. When you ask people for their opinions, you're exposing yourself to new ideas and ways of thinking. It's like, you might not have thought of something yourself, but someone else has, and that's cool! It's like, you're learning something new every time you talk to someone. And that's awesome!

Another thing is that it helps you make better decisions. Like, if you're trying to decide on a movie to watch, and you ask your friends for their opinions, you might find out that one of them has seen it and can give you a really good review. Or, if you're trying to decide on a restaurant to go to, and you ask your family for their opinions, they might have some great suggestions that you wouldn't have thought of yourself. It's like, you're getting all these different viewpoints, and it helps you make a better decision.

And, it's also really helpful when you're trying to solve a problem. Like, if you're having trouble with a math problem, and you ask your teacher for help, they might be able to give you a different perspective on how to solve it. Or, if you're trying to figure out why someone did something, and you ask them for their side of the story, you might learn something new that helps you understand the situation better. It's like, getting multiple opinions helps you see the problem from different angles, and that can be really helpful.

Okay, so, I know I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I think that's pretty cool. I mean, it's like, when you're talking to people, you're learning new things and getting new ideas all the time. And, it's not just about learning new things, it's about understanding people better too. Like, when you ask someone for their opinion, you're showing them that you value their thoughts and ideas, and that's a";1
"Twenty five years ago there was something that had appeared on a Red Planet called Cydonia. An enormous head about two miles from end to end. As the pictures show people think it looks like a face.

Scientists believe that it was just another Martian mesa, these are very common on the planet. But, there was unusual shadows that made it appear to look like an Egyptian Paraoh.

Some people think that the face evidence of life on Mars. Few scientists believe that the face was an alien artifact. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over the planet for the first time, the camera was better than before and had more clearer images of the face. Revealing a natural landform, there was no alien monument after all. Skeptics said that alien marking were hidden by a haze. This landform was most definetly not an alien monument, even though it looks like one. They compare the ""face"" on the planet to a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. the Middle Butte is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated Mesa about the same height as the ""face"" on mars.

"Have you ever played a sport in school and did not have time to do anything when you got home?

I used to play baseball and every evening when I got home from practice, I would have to go straight to bed.

I disagree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you might not have time to do homework, spend time with family members, and have time to spend by yourself to read a book or play video games.

Every night during school the teachers would give each class the same amount of homework, and on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I had baseball practice, and sometimes I had a baseball game on Saturdays which means every two days I would have twice as much homework as everyone else because I wasn't able to get the homework done the night it was assigned. Now that I am no longer playing baseball I am able to keep up with my classes this semester.

Homework is a big responsibility to some people because they try their hardest to keep straight A's on their report card.

Homework can be challenging to some people because they might not know how to do something, so they ask their parents/ guardian to help them but if they some kind of practice after school then they might not get home until 8:30 and have to go straight to bed like I did.

Spending time with your family members can be fun because you might be able to play board games and/or card games.

Spending time with family you have not seen in a long time will help you get caught up on what has happened since you last saw them.

Family is one of the most important people in the world, if God never made you any family you would have no one to go to when your heart is broken, you need help with personal problems, and if you are very old and can not move the way you used to be able to, then they will always be there for you whenever you need them.

Have you ever wanted to just sit down and read your favorite book by yourself, but then your mom walks into your room and says, ""Time to get ready for your game"" just as you was about to start reading?

Well imagine being in the middle of a very competitive game with your friends, and your mom tells you to get p and turn our X-box off, but you ask if you can finish the game and she says,""No, because you need to get ready to go to your baseball game, and they will be there when you get back.""

One time I was half way through the pages of my book and it got to a really amazing part of the story and the I had t get ready to leave, I hated that day because I basically left on a cliffhanger.

Have you ever played a sport in school and did not have time to do anything when you got home. Homework can be challenging for some people because they might not know what to do. Family is one of the most important people in the world. Have you ever wanted to just sit down and read your favorite book by yourself? I disagree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities. ";0
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so I'm super excited to write this essay about AD Assets Inc.! 🤩 I've been learning about them in school and they seem like an awesome company to work with. My teacher told us we could join this thing called Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) to learn more about AD Assets and even take part in competitions and exams. I'm totally down to learn more and maybe even go on a field trip there! 🏡🚀

So, AD Assets Inc. is this company that helps other businesses with their advertising and marketing stuff. They have all these cool tools and resources that can help businesses reach more people and sell more stuff. It's like, they make it easy for businesses to be successful! 💡 And the best part is, they're always looking for new and creative ways to help their clients. Like, they're not just stuck in the same old ways of doing things. They're always pushing the boundaries and trying new things. 💥

I think it would be so cool to learn more about how they do things and maybe even work there one day! 💼 I mean, can you imagine being a part of a company that's all about helping other businesses succeed? It's like, you get to be a part of something bigger than yourself and help people make their dreams come true! 🌟 And who knows, maybe I'll even get to go on that field trip they mentioned! 🤩

So, I'm definitely going to join FBLA and learn as much as I can about AD Assets Inc. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me! 🎉 Thanks for reading my essay! 😊";1
"Dear principle,

I would rather prefer policy one, which is that cell phones can be allowed in school and you can use them in lunch time or other free times as long as you do not use them in class. Students think that they can just be cool and use their cell phones in class and hide them behind their books that they are reading. News flash for you kids out there that do that , you can get in a lot of trouble for doing that. The reason that they do not allow us to use cell phones during class is because you could text some one during a test that has already took that test and ask for the answers or if you are doing a review for a class.

By doing that you could get phones took away from school permanently. All because you didn't want to study, so you thought you could text someone and get the answers. If to many people did that then we could get them took away permanently from school and never be able to take them on campus. I do love to text and I am sure that most kids my age do. It is not abnormal to want to text all the time.

However whatever you want to send to someone on the phone can wait until after school. Or if you need to tell your parents something or ask them something, do not text them and ask or tell in the middle of class, just go to the office and ask if you can use their phone. I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school, but if we keep texting during class I could completely understand why we couldn't take them to school. Please principle do not take our phones out of school!";0
"Some schools offer distance learnimg as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video confercing. In other words this would alow students to stay home and still be abul to get ther work done on time. This might be a good reson becouse some kids have jobs or family things to do during the day. Sometimes if kids are geting buled in school they can tack there class frome home and not have to deel with other students or if a student get suspended they can still take there class wale they are out of school. schools offering distance learning is not a good idea becouse some students are not acountuble enufe to do all there work,some people need help face to face,it is a lot esery to cheat..

For example some studentsare not acountuble enuf to take online class they just take it so they dont have to goo to school. they wont do there work and give exuses as to why they have noy comepleated there school work it is also harder to keep up with thes students becous who knows how meney students the online teachers have and most of them probley teach school during the day so on top of the schoolday work that they have to grade now they have to try and keep up with kids who dont want to do any work or meed deadlines. if students are doing work they are most likey cheating on there work,tests of quizs beacouse it is way esery to cheat on a test at home then it is to do it at school.

like when some students need face to face help then learn and this is not always avabule to them so therefor they might not be able to do there school and then have a bad grade in the class. if the students where in school they would get help if they needed it and it woukd be a lot esery for them to manige them self. there are meney other facters as to why on like school is a bad idae for some students but one of the most impornted things is that they allways have actses to the help that they need.

in other words cheating is a big problum in ower schools today and that is with teachers in the classroom now just take the teacher out of the room and give a teast there will be some cheaters but now they can take it at home and when they do they can look up all the ancers on there phone or computer they might get a good grade but they didint luarn anything in that class so when they go to take ther sol they will probly fail and have to take it agan and study even harder in order to pass and graduate.

"Germany-Residents are suburan pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

Street parking, driveways and hoem garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Car ownerships are allowed to park on the edge of the street, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development. They buy space for 40,000 along with their home.

70 percert of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move  here. They all say they are much happy this way and love that they sold their car just to move somewhere they wanted to live. People that are walking down the street usually get talked about and get weird stares because most people have car and don't walk.

In 2006, Vauban completed an example of a growing trend in Europe, teh United States and elsewhere to seperate suburan life from auto use, a compnonet called ""smart planning.""

Middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to mkae their homes. Experts say thats a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. 12 percent green house gas emissions in Europe and up to50 percent some car-intensive areas in the United States.

New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, ere the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act cautiosly. IN the previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

In Colombia a program that's set to spread to other countried, millions of Coolombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leavingthe street to this capital city eerly devoid of traffic jams.

The third straight year cars have been banned with only busses and tavis permiteed for the Day Without Cars int his capital of 7 million. The goal is; promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

The day without cars is part of an omprovement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Its seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of Latin American city, according to the mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bllomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replace by bread, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will geta fortuitous assist. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year passes. The United States, has no longer been on of the world's prime car cultures.

America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When they adjusted the population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. In January 1995, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was.

Many sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle. With all these cahnges, people who stopeed car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question.

At the Mobile World Congrew last year in Barecelone, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. Publice transportation traffic, pedestrains, bicycles, private cars, commercial are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.                               ";0
"As an 8th grade student, I have been assigned to write an essay on the topic of ""Improving Knowledge and Understanding"" and I couldn't be more excited! In this essay, I will be discussing the ways to improve knowledge and understanding of various subjects, including Algebra, English language skills, and becoming a doctor.

To start with, I will be researching the work of Emerson and identifying the statement referenced in the essay. Emerson was a well-known American essayist, lecturer, and poet who believed in the importance of self-reliance and individualism. According to Emerson, ""The only way to have a better future is to challenge oneself to have a better present."" This statement resonates with me because it highlights the importance of taking action and making changes in our lives in order to achieve our goals.

Next, I will be researching ways to improve knowledge and understanding of Algebra. Algebra is a fundamental subject in mathematics that is essential for success in many fields, including science, engineering, and computer science. To improve my knowledge and understanding of Algebra, I will be watching video lectures, practicing problems, and taking online quizzes. I will also be seeking help from my teacher or tutor if I need it.

In addition to Algebra, I will be researching ways to improve my English language skills. English is a crucial subject in school and in life, and being able to communicate effectively is essential for success in any field. To improve my English skills, I will be reading books, writing essays, and practicing speaking and listening to English. I will also be using online resources such as grammar guides and vocabulary builders to help me improve my skills.

Another important subject that I will be researching is how to become a doctor. Becoming a doctor is a challenging and rewarding career that requires many years of hard work and dedication. To become a doctor, I will need to complete a bachelor's degree in a pre-medical field, attend medical school, and complete a residency program. I will also need to pass the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and gain experience through volunteering or shadowing doctors.

Furthermore, I will be investigating job opportunities to support my";1
"Group Work vs. Individual Work: Which is Better?

Working in a group or alone? Which one is more beneficial? This is a question that has been debated for a long time, and there are valid arguments for both sides. While some people might argue that working alone is more efficient and productive, I believe that working in a group has more advantages.

First of all, when working in a group, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with more creative solutions. When I work alone, I tend to get stuck in my own thoughts and ideas, and I don't always see the bigger picture. But when I work with others, we can share our perspectives and come up with solutions that none of us would have thought of on our own. For example, in a recent group project, we were tasked with creating a new product for a local business. By working together, we were able to come up with a product that was more innovative and practical than anything any of us could have come up with alone.

Another advantage of working in a group is that you can divide tasks and responsibilities among your team members. This can save time and reduce stress, as everyone knows what they are responsible for and can work on their part without having to worry about the entire project. For instance, in a science fair project I worked on last year, we divided the tasks among ourselves based on our strengths and interests. This allowed us to focus on our individual parts and make sure everything was completed on time.

Working in a group also promotes teamwork and communication skills. When you work alone, you don't have to worry about coordinating with anyone else or dealing with conflicts. But when you work in a group, you have to learn how to work together, listen to each other's ideas, and compromise. These skills are essential in any profession, and they can help you succeed in both personal and professional life.

Finally, working in a group can be more fun than working alone. When you're working with others, you have someone to share the experience with and to bounce ideas off of. You can also learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and you can motivate each other to do your best. For example, in a recent art project, we worked together to create a mural.";1
"Title: The Power of Growth: My Experiences and Emerson's Insights

Introduction:
Hey there, it's me, [Your Name], an average 8th grader, and today I'm going to talk about growth and how it's super important in our lives. I'm gonna share my own experiences learning to play the guitar, and then I'll tell you about this cool guy named Ralph Waldo Emerson who said some really deep stuff about growth too. So, let's get started!

My Experiences:
So, I've been playing the guitar for like, a year now, and it's been a wild ride. At first, it was really hard, like, my fingers would hurt so much and I couldn't even play a full song. But then I set a goal for myself to learn more songs and practice every day, and it started to get easier. Now I can play like, a bunch of songs and even write my own music! It's so cool to see how far I've come and how much I've grown as a musician.

Emerson's Insights:
Ralph Waldo Emerson was this really smart guy who lived a long time ago, and he said some stuff about growth that I think is super true. He said, ""Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment."" That means don't be afraid to try new things and take risks, because that's how we grow and learn. He also said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That's so important because it means that we should be proud of who we are and not try to change ourselves to fit in with what others want us to be.

Why It's Hard to Keep Growing:
But, it's not always easy to keep growing and pushing ourselves beyond what we have already mastered. Sometimes it can be hard to stay motivated and keep practicing, especially when things get tough. Like, when I was first starting out with the guitar, I would get frustrated when I couldn't play something right away, but now I know that it's okay to make mistakes and that they'";1

"Introduction

Knowledge and imagination are two essential components of human existence. While imagination allows us to envision possibilities and create new ideas, knowledge provides us with the foundation to understand and apply these ideas in reality. In this essay, I will argue that knowledge is more important than imagination.

Body

Firstly, knowledge provides us with the ability to make informed decisions. Without knowledge, we would be relying solely on our imagination and intuition, which can often lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, imagine a person who wants to start a business. Without knowledge of the industry, they may have a great idea but lack the necessary skills and information to make it a success. However, with knowledge of the industry, they can make informed decisions and take the necessary steps to ensure their business thrives.

Secondly, knowledge allows us to understand the world around us. Imagination can only take us so far, but knowledge provides us with the facts and information we need to truly understand the world. Without knowledge, we would be living in a world of speculation and assumptions, rather than one based on facts and evidence. For example, imagine a person who believes that vaccines are harmful. Without knowledge of the scientific evidence and research that supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines, they are making an uninformed decision that can harm themselves and others.

Thirdly, knowledge provides us with the ability to innovate and create new ideas. While imagination is essential for coming up with new ideas, knowledge is necessary to understand and apply these ideas in a practical and effective way. For example, imagine a person who has a great idea for a new product, but lacks the knowledge of the materials and manufacturing processes necessary to bring it to life. However, with knowledge of these processes, they can create a product that not only meets their imagination but also meets the needs of their customers.

Conclusion

In conclusion, knowledge is more important than imagination. While imagination allows us to envision possibilities and create new ideas, knowledge provides us with the foundation to understand and apply these ideas in reality. Knowledge allows us to make informed decisions, understand the world around us, and innovate and create new ideas. Therefore, it is crucial that we prioritize knowledge and continue to seek out new information and knowledge in order to improve our lives and the world around us.";1
"Sure, here's my essay response:

Hey, so like, I remember this one time when I was really motivated to do more than I usually do. It was during the summer before 8th grade, and my parents signed me up for this super cool robotics camp. I was like, ""Ugh, do I have to?"", but then I realized it would be a great opportunity to learn something new and challenge myself.

So, I went to the camp and it was way more fun than I expected. We built these awesome robots and programmed them to do cool things like drive around and pick up objects. I was so into it, and I started to realize that I was actually pretty good at it. It was like, this whole new world opened up for me, and I was like, ""Wow, I never knew I could do this!""

But, it wasn't all easy. There were times when I got frustrated and didn't understand something, but my instructors were super helpful and encouraging. They taught me how to problem solve and think outside the box, which was really cool. I learned that even when things get tough, you can still push through and come out on top.

After the camp, I started to apply those skills to other areas of my life. I started taking on more challenges in school and in my free time, and I found that I was able to accomplish things I never thought I could do before. It was like, I had this whole new sense of confidence and motivation, and I was like, ""I can do anything!""

So, in conclusion, that one experience really taught me the value of pushing myself and trying new things. It helped me grow and learn in ways I never thought possible, and I'm so glad my parents signed me up for that camp. It was, like, totally worth it. 😃";1
"Do you know any of your friends that are active in sports or any other after-school events? Chances are, most students likely participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it's a sport, club, instrument, or an extra-credit elective for school. However, there are still quite a few pupils who remain idle in such opportunities when given the chance by their guardians or teachers; this may be because they believe that it will only take away their time. I believe that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it can help them expand their social circle, improve overall work quality, and look appealing when submitting resumes to applicators in a specific school or occupation.

To start, it gives the opportunity to expand the student's social circle by having them work and communicate with others. For example, if a pupil is struggling to socialize with other classmates, they can find an after-school activity that will allow them to interact with people with the same interests as them. That way, it is easier to find something to relate with, and can even create lifelong relationships from thereon. In my personal experience, joining orchestra has done countless of positive factors in my social life; I have created very good friendships that I would've never made if I hadn't joined the orchestra, even with people that I would've never imagined becoming friends if it weren't for our shared interest.

Secondly, it improves overall work quality in school because outside knowledge gained from these activities can be applied and comprehended into schoolwork.

Although it may seem like extracurricular activities will not help in school, there will always be at least one characteristic that positively correlates with the work you perform in class. In fact, studies have shown that students who participate in at least one after-school event typically perform significantly higher than those who do not, particularly in subjects that they previously struggled in. In addition, when I first started Tae Kwon Do, I was a very unfocused pupil in my class and had trouble with discipline and time management skills. But as a result from consistently taking the classes every week, my work ethics and discipline improved significantly due to the constant drilling I went through.

Finally, the events you participate in can give off an exceptional impression when applying for a certain school or job. In order for you to stand out among others, especially when applying for more rigorous universities, the activities you take outside of class are the main characteristics of your resume that people look at. They look for factors that set you aside from other applicants, knowing that you put in the extra effort to excel in your classes and hobbies; otherwise, you are merely another out of a thousand candidates that happened to take a few honors courses. This is why such activities are extremely vital not only for personal preferences but for academical purposes.

In short, extracurricular activities should indeed be required for all these reasons. Many students may oppose against this belief due to the lingering thought that it may take away their free time or they are simply afraid of meeting new people in a new environment. However, it is important to keep in mind that although they may think that is the case, it will most definitely benefit them in the future, especially when college comes near. If students took the time to find an extracurricular activity that they are interested in, then they will see more positive than negative outcomes in their daily and social lives. In the end, it's up to them to decide for themselves, but they must know that their future counts more than their personal wants. ";0
"The situation of giving away projects for students to do over summer is a very difficult task because in order to satisfy both ends some things may need to be sacrificed. Teachers should be the ones picking projects over students because how they know what is best for their students. In order to accept the needs and wants of both sides it is best to have the leader of it all to pick what to assign and what not to assign. If the immature students are able to pick what they get to do, their learning over summer will be endangered.

Teachers are best for picking what projects to give to students because they are able to base their decisions based on what the students need most over what they want most. Students picking may not be able to know what is best to develop because they have only been here once; furthermore, teachers are able to know what students need because they have taught for many years and are able to distinguish what is best for the students and what may end up in a lack or even a decline of progress for projects to do over summer.

Students picking what is best for their own projects may end in many ways. The students can make it seem like the work is helping and they are benefiting when they are actually just making it so easy that they can still get away with doing no learning over break if they pick the project. They may also make it based on what they need to work on but just make it super easy to a point where the work they do does not even benefit them. Either one of these is counterproductive and there should be a better option made. It can be seen in the book

The Perfect Storm how when people take on something where they are less experienced that they will fail to reach the goal that the group is hoping for; for example, in

The Perfect Storm the sailors all died because they were not experienced enough to take on a storm that big and were unprepared. a situation like this is just as likely with these less experienced students who may be picking their own projects to do over summer. If this is the case their ships may sink as well and they will not get the learning that they need over summer

The argument can be made that students are actually able to be responsible and that they should be able to pick their own projects. This point is very valid for the responsible students; contrasting this, the assertion can be made that out of every batch of students, there is always a bad egg. The irresponsible students, especially younger and more immature ones, should not be trusted with picking a somewhat annoying project to them, that will get in the way of their free time, time to hang out with friends, and time to play video games. This time is very important to them, especially over summer vacation, and they will do whatever they can to not have to do a lot of work and be able to relax.

In conclusion, the ability for teachers to control the students' projects allows for well planned projects that allow them to continue learning, which would otherwise be negatively affected if the students were the ones deciding. With the large education that those teachers were able to get in order to be there, it can be seen that a project given by them would be far more educational and productive than one made by the students. In order to make a good project to give, it takes experience and maturity, without these it would be like there is nothing useful being done for these students over summer.";0
"Hey there!  So, you wanna know about activities that can help us overcome fear and make memories with family and friends?  Well, let me tell ya, I've got a few ideas! 🤔

First of all, have you tried facing your fears head-on? Like, literally?  I know it sounds crazy, but trust me, it works! 😅 My friends and I recently went on a camping trip in the mountains, and let me tell you, it was freakin' scary at first.  But, we pushed through it and had an amazing time. We told ghost stories, roasted marshmallows, and even went on a hike to see a waterfall.  And you know what? It was so much fun! 🎉 We laughed, we screamed, and we even saw a real-life ghost! 👻 (Just kidding about that last part, but you get the idea.)

Another thing you can do is try something new with your fam or friends. Like, ever heard of rock climbing?  It's like, this awesome adventure where you climb up these huge walls using these weird contraptions called ""ropes"" and ""harnesses.""  And it's not just for superheroes or something!  You can totally do it too! My friends and I went last summer, and it was lit!  We cheered each other on, and even though we were all terrified at first, we managed to make it to the top!  And the view from up there? 😍 It was like, whoa. 🤯

Lastly, have you ever tried playing games with your loved ones?  I know, I know, it sounds boring, but trust me, it's not!  My friends and I recently started playing this super fun game called ""Murder in the Dark.""  It's like, a murder mystery game where we have";1
"Taking responsibility for oneself is one of the most important lessons we can learn in life. Doing so empowers us to make more of our own decisions, become more independent, and better manage our lives. It also allows us to work towards our own goals and ambitions, instead of relying on others. 

We can begin taking responsibility for ourselves as soon as possible in life. For example, set goals for yourself that you want to achieve and break these goals down into smaller, actionable tasks. This way, it will be easier for you to focus on what you need to do to move closer to the goal. In addition, budgeting and taking control of your finances are also important steps that you can take to become more responsible for yourself. Finally, think about your own decisions and whether or not they are healthy and beneficial. Consider the different outcomes of those decisions, and make sure they are aligned with your values and goals.

Taking responsibility for yourself is an important step in achieving success and happiness. It allows us to create our own paths and make our own decisions that will bring us closer to our own dreams and goals. We should strive to take responsibility for ourselves as soon as possible in life, because doing so empowers us to be independent and successful.";1
"You would get a lot of different answers from a lot of peopleif you were to go up to sme and ask them on what they think about the driverless car. But if you were to go and ask me that question i would have to say that I don't think we need to really be focusing on that as much as we should for other thngs in this world, it isnt as safe and could be very dangerous, there isnt anything wrong with having others drive themsleves.

First, I personally believe that there are more serious issues going on in this world that we should be focusing on more and putting more ofthe money twoards that then spending millions trying to get a car to drive by itself. A driverless car is not something we need to be worrying about when we can keep it easy and simple like it has been for many years and just have drivers driving the car.

Secondly, it has yet to been passed by the law due to safety percautions. As of right now the driverless cars are not as safe as a car that has some one driving the vechile. So with that reason whhy there I dont feel like what the need is to try and create something when we are all doing fine and would be doing even better then the driverless car.

Lastly, why fix something if it isnt broken? i get that driverless cars could be helpful for some people at times but to solve that problem that's what taxi's are for. Everythng has been fine with having the people drive the car themselves. People will be more alert then the driverless car itself so it is just best to just keep it as the way it has been going and let the people drive the car themsleves because there isn't anything wrong with doong it like that.

In conclusion, if you were to want to hear my opionin on what I have to say about the driverless cars I would say I think they are neat and could be somethng big in the future to come. As of now though I think that there are bigger things going on in this world right now that we should be focusing on, they are not proven to be as safe then what it is with having someone driving the vechile. And there is not a big problem on having people drive the cars themsleves so there isnt a big need for a solution like this.";0
"Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?

During summer break some schools require teachers to give out summer projects to assure that students continue to learn while on vacation. Even though students may not enjoy getting it done, it gives the teacher feedback on how well you are learning in the summertime. These projects are either teacher-designed or student designed. While teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages, summer projects need to be student-designed so that it is less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster.

When projects are teacher-designed, teachers will usually design them as more difficult to do so that it can give their students a challenge to do better. This technique is often done by teachers but what they do not realize is that when teachers design projects that are more challenging it is much harder on the student to understand, let alone get the project done. On the other hand, some students may be out of the country the whole summer so giving them teacher-designed projects that are challenging will give them a harder time for them to learn or get the assignment done.

In the past I have had a very hard time getting most of my projects done because of lack of motivation and because of the way teachers design certain projects. If students are the ones to design it, it will increase the amount of students who do the project because they are the ones who are designing it. In addition making it much more easier for them to understand and get the project done. If summer projects are student-designed, students will not have to use the excuse of not getting the project done because they ""didn't understand it"", instead their will be no excuse because they are the ones who to designed it, not the teacher.

Most students work a lot faster than others because of lack of understanding. Although teachers may not even realize it, they design these projects in ways in which students will often have a hard time with having at least some progress done because they simply do not know where to begin. When the student is the one who is able to design it, it allows them to have the opportunity to decide what to include and what not to, so that it makes their learning easier. In addition, having summer projects be student-designed allows them to work twice as faster than using teacher-designed projects because the student is the one that knows what they have to include.

In conclusion teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages but all projects need to be student-designed because at the end of the day the student is the one who is learning. All projects should be student-designed for these reasons: less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster. Summer projects that are student-designed instead of teacher-designed ensures that the student is more likely to succeed. In addition teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages but all projects need to be student-designed because at the end of the day the student is the one who is learning.    ";0
"Think about it have you ever not been able to do extracurricular activities? See look I disagree that kids should have to do one because not all kids are able to stay after school and get a ride home. Parents can always be there for the kid due to work. Also some kids aren't mentally stable to do extracurricular activities.

Students wouldnt have enough time to do there homework. Some kids have way too much homework they have to do and they might not have all the time to finish it all. Kids would have to stay up until like 1-2 AM doing all there projects and homework. When its due the next day.

Students would get home late. Kids would have no time with there family due to the amount homework they have to do. They would have to eat dinner later then normal and wouldnt eat it with their family. Students would get no sleep due to amount of homework, the time they get home, and the time they eat dinner. Students would get home late and not have time to do anything they normally would be able to do.

Kids would be stressed out. They would be stressed due to the amount of home work, getting rides home, and by all the school work and chores they have to do. Being stressed out can impact their metal health and cause them to fail classes due to the amount of work. Some students dont have rides home and they could stay there for hours due to not being able to get picked up.

In conclusion I think that they shouldn't be required to do extracurricular activities due to the many reasons they cant get dropped off, picked up and stuff like that. Some kids would get home late. They might not have enough time to do homework. Plus they would be stressed out over everything. ";0
"Problems are a natural part of life, and everyone experiences them at some point. Whether it's a small issue like forgetting a homework assignment or a major problem like losing a job, it's important to have effective strategies in place to deal with them. In this essay, I will discuss some strategies that people use to effectively deal with problems and analyze an example of a problem involving multiple people. I will also explain how trying one's best in problem-solving can lead to a better path, the importance of not underestimating any problem, the value of mistakes as learning opportunities, and how no one is ever alone when it comes to problem-solving.

One effective strategy for dealing with problems is to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help make the problem seem less overwhelming and more approachable. For example, if you're struggling with a complex math problem, you might start by breaking it down into smaller parts and working through each one step by step. This can help you understand the problem better and find a solution more easily.

Another strategy is to seek help from others. It's important to remember that no one is ever alone when it comes to problem-solving. Whether it's talking to a friend, family member, or teacher, seeking help from others can provide a fresh perspective and new ideas for solving a problem. For example, if you're having trouble with a group project, you might talk to your group members and brainstorm ideas together. This can help you come up with a solution that works for everyone.

It's also important to not underestimate any problem, big or small. Even small problems can have a big impact on our lives, and ignoring them can lead to bigger problems down the line. For example, if you're having trouble with a class, it's important to address the problem early on before it becomes more difficult to catch up. Ignoring the problem could lead to lower grades and a lack of understanding of the material, which could have a negative impact on your future.

Mistakes can be used as learning opportunities. Instead of dwelling on a mistake, it's important to learn from it and use it as a chance to do better in the future. For example, if you made a mistake on a test, you might review the material and identify areas where you need to improve.";1
"Should students have to participate in extracurricular activities? I say that students should participate in an activity because they can make new friends, find a new hobby they enjoy, and maybe find what career they might like. First, students could go outside of their friend group and make new friends to spend their time with. Second, kids can become more active and healthy. Lastly, students can find what career they might be interested in. In conclusion, after school activities are good for students to grow in friendship, mentality, and physicality.

First, students could go outside of their friend group and make new friends to spend their time with. Some kids may not have friends in their activity, so giving them a friend could make them feel good. Making new friends can also help become more social and friendly. For example, I played volleyball this season and I made friends with people who use to scare me, now they have taught me to be a better player and friend. All in all, students can make new friends that can encourage and boost each other up during their activity.

Second, kids can become more active and healthy from extracurricular activities. Students are able to play sports and stay in shape. For example, I used to be very unhealthy, but then I joined volleyball and I became very athletic and healthy. Although, you do not have to play a sport, you could join a choir to work on your breathing and your lungs. After school activities keep students in a very healthy state.

Lastly, students can find what career they might be interested in from doing an extracurricular activity. If students have a passion there might be an activity where they can learn more about it. Likewise, I want to be in the medical field, so I am volunteering at my local hospital. Similarly, if you want to do online design you might join the yearbook staff. Extracurricular activities can help students find what they really want to pursue in life.

In conclusion, after school activities are good for students to grow in friendship, mentality, and physicality. While doing activities students become better people and peers. Finally, students are able to step out of their comfort zone and do something they may have never known they liked.";0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the concept of succeeding without failure as an average 8th grade student:

Succeeding Without Failure: Can it Really Happen?

Have you ever wondered if it's possible to succeed without failing? I mean, let's be real, failure is a part of life, right? We all fail at some point or another, whether it's in school, sports, or even just trying to make new friends. But what if I told you that there are people out there who have never failed? That's right, never. They're like superheroes, flying high above the rest of us, effortlessly achieving their goals without ever experiencing defeat.

But wait, there's more! Not only can people succeed without failing, but they can also do it without even trying that hard. Like, think about it, have you ever met someone who's just naturally good at everything they do? They're like a one-person success machine, churning out A's and trophies without breaking a sweat. It's like they have a special power or something.

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""But what about all the times they mess up? Don't they ever make mistakes?"" And the answer is, of course they do! But here's the thing, they don't let those mistakes hold them back. They learn from them, pick themselves up, and keep on going. They're like the Hulk, smashing through obstacles with ease and determination.

So, can people really succeed without failure? The answer is, absolutely! It's not about never failing, it's about how you handle failure when it does happen. If you can learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward, you'll be unstoppable. Just like a superhero, you'll have the power to overcome any obstacle and achieve your goals.

In conclusion, succeeding without failure is definitely possible. It's not about being perfect, it's about being determined and resilient. So, the next time you're feeling discouraged by a setback, just remember, you too can be a superhero of success!";1
"Phones and driving

It is reported that cell phone use while driving leads to millions of crashes each year, and that's sometimes due to drivers trying to use their phones at any given time of the day, whilst behind a moving automobile. Even though smartphones have made it easier for people to stay connected, there's no need for letting the ins and outs of smartphones to run their lives. The distraction rates of cell phones are alarmingly high, given the fact that the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Those reasons stand alone, as to why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle.

Recent general cell phone statistics states that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Operating a vehicle requires someone to be fully focused on their surroundings, as they are not only driving for themselves, but every pedestrians and motorists. Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road and that's all it can take for and accident to happen within the blink of an eye or even worse, a causality.

94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving, and rightly so, it's bad enough that there are many distractions when driving, but eliminating one of the biggest distractions, is the beginning of heading into a right direction. The behavior of using cell phones while driving is common and dangerous.

In conclusion, to the many dangers of driving, cell phone should be on of the top priorities to eliminate. With the help of drivers who support this claim, it should be even more of a indication, because as sad as it is, people are not as educated about phones and driving, as they could be.      ";0
"I bet that if you went around a public school asking kids where they would rather be doing school online or in a school, I bet that the majority of the kids would say they would much rather be doing school like they're now. Why is this, well being a teenager is probably one of the greatest things that can ever happen in your life, we can definitely agree that some of the people that we meet in high school are going to be our friends for a long time and that can sometimes benefit us in the long run, and really the only benefit of being at home for your classes would be being in the comfort of your own home.

Going to school in the morning is probably the worst thing in the world, because I know that when I wake up in the morning I tell myself that I really do not want to go to school, but later on in the day when I wake up it isn't so bad at all. Really I just sit in a classroom and listen to a teacher lecture for an hour and thirty minutes, the only thing that really sucks is how late that we get out because by the time that we get out it's pretty much already dinner time and we still need to do our homework. So being at home throughout your school day would be awesome but you really have the think about the long run, when you grow up you're going to have a job where you work with people, and if you cannot do that then you might get fired. Some more things that can benefit you at a public school could be a library, councilor, and teachers. You don't have an open library when you're home schooled or you don't have school councilors to help you if you have any questions and the real life interaction that you get with your teachers is so much better than having a teacher try to explain you something through a screen. Pretty much the only thing that I would change about my public school is how late we get in and how late we get out, all of the other schools around us get to school around 7:30am and get out around 2:45pm and that would be great because we would be be to get so much more done like homework and projects that you waited last minute for. Getting home at 4:30 in the afternoon sucks I get home and eat dinner right away pretty much and by the time that i'm done with dinner I have to go to practice and that ends at 9:30 don't get home till about 10:30 then that leaves no time for homework.

So in conclusion going to school at a public or private school would be much better than being home schooled, there are just so many more reasons to be going to a public school than being home schooled it's cheaper it has way more things that can support you like friends, and teachers. So I bet that if you still went around asking students where they would of rather been doing school most of them would still say a public school. ";0
"Cars have become an important part of our world. From their rising fame came consequences that effected our daily lives and our enviornment. Limiting car use can have advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making ones community better to live in.

By limiting car usage, the amount of greenhouse gasses- gasses produced by exaust, carbon dioxide, etc.- would be reduced. Greenhouse gasses effect the ozone layer of the earths atmosphere and that in turn effects the health of everyone breathing in the earths oxygen. Greenhouse gasses, albiet the healthy sounding name, is not good for people or the enviornment. By limiting car usage, people can put a dent in the amount of greenhouse gasses being produced. ""Passenger cars are responsible for for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (5) This means people can change the world by simply reducing their car usage.

Changing the way one lives can change the way they look at life. Some people in the community of Vauban have found happiness just by reducing their car usage. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two"" (3) In this community people get to experience walking down the street, hearing people instead of the constant sound of a running car. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" The people living in the community don't have to go out of their way to buy something when they can just walk down the street and purchase it. The town of Vauban entertains the choice of effeciency and health over inconvienence and unsafe air.

Limiting car useage can have many advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making one's  community better. Although cars are convienent the people in the town of Vauban would rather live in a reduced car community.    ";0
I am definitely against this proposal to the school. I think it would be very wrong to have only the students that have a B average play sports. Sports should be for everyone, but, I do think you should lower the standard's for the school, only because you don't have to be smart to play a professional sport when you grow up, so it's just like your giving the not-so-smart kids no kind of chance. They may be really good at sports. I think they should have to have a C- average. Just to give everyone I chance in doing a sport. Or set a specific grade point average, like my school does, you have to have a 2.0 or over to play a sport. Which I think is perfectly fine. We have really good players. And plus, maybe the really smart students aren't that good at football, or basketball, or other sports. Maybe they have more important stuff to do then practice, like homework. That's why I think you should lower your standards, or just set a specific grade point average because it wouldn't be fair to the kids that are really good, but don't do that well in school. Maybe they just have personal issues, or something. You shouldn't exclude them from any sport activities. Maybe they'll go pro one day. If you only let the B average students play the under average students may have nothing to look forward too. Maybe the only thing they looked forward to is sports.;0
"Distance learning not only flexible but also beneficial to students who struggles attending school. School is about seven hours long and starts early in the morning. There are students who cannot simply meet ends when it comes to school along with the timing and environment. Students who struggles with attending school tend to struggle with mental issues, problems at home, or preference.

A big factor of students failure to attend school results to ongoing mental issues. Students who has depression, anxiety, or any sort of mental issues typically is harder for them to attend school while something is off. Mental illness tends to make people tired, unmotivated, sad, distracted, etc. I struggle with depression and anxiety, along those lines it is harder for me to wake up and I lose the will to go to school and sleep instead. I have no motivation to do homework, interact, or leave my room. Missing a lot of days will cause you to be behind and you're left with a pill of graded work and nothing but anxiety attacks and breakdowns. It's like a never ending cycle and being put in distance learning to provide the alternative option to make up for the lost times.

School is hard enough but making ends meet while having bigger, harder issues at home won't make it any easier. Underprivileged students struggle with abuse, money, and adult responsibilities. Students cannot afford their own transportation or cannot make the bills or groceries. This results kids on taking responsibilities, such as getting a job, to help with food, bills, and clothes. Students in these position may be suffering with poverty or parents/ guardians who are not fully capable supporting their kids due to addictions, overworked, or personal issues. These students are over worked and does not have the ability to make it to school simply because they don't see it as important as trying to survive. Not every student want to go to school with a bruised up face or beaten bodies because they're being physically abused. Students are afraid of their parents, especially when it comes to beating and fear of getting their parents caught up and getting a beating due to that. Not every student that attends school has the privilege to go back home with a loving and welcoming parents greet you, a fridge full of food, the bills are paid, and clean clothes. Attending the distance learning will provide a easier education working around their schedule and giving them more free time to either make ends meet or to work more hours.

It's hard enough to wake up early in the morning, get dressed, and go to school. Students has preference when it comes to their learning environment, like adults when it comes to their work environment. Unlike students, they typically cannot pick and choose when they are restricted to the school district within the distance of their home. te process of transferring out will be tougher since they have to provide their own transportation and pay the fee, the chances of that happening are unlikely. Along with transferring out, some parents would not allow it due not understanding their child's reasoning or are completely blindsided by the ongoing issues. The environment is such a big deal, it can negatively or positively impact a student based on their needs. Not every student wants to go to a place five days a week, seven hours a day to hear teachers get on them, students being loud in the halls for no reason, unnecessary drama, or simply a place that makes them feel trapped. Not everyone can work around so many people and be trigger instead. There are students who prefers doing everything online and about 75% percent of class work is online now these days along with exams and finals. Having to switch to distance learning won't be much of a change since schools are currently converting to online classwork, tests, activities, and homework.

One may state that distance learning will make cheating a lot easier. Students may have easy access towards the internet making it easier for them to cheat but there are programs restricting students to exit the site. Although it may seem like a bad idea, teachers requires students to show work and that clearly an easy option when it comes to cheating. This will makes the student research the unit and teach themselves while in the process of learning. There is such a positive effect with it comes to distance learning and it will teach students to be on their work without anyone telling them, learn the ability to teach themselves, and a form of communication when it come to contacting their teacher or simply asking for help.

Distance learning provides a great alternitive to students that have a hard time attending school. To students that struggle, there are always going to be bigger issues that they will priortize over school. These students wants to try and with distance learning this will give them to opportinity and work with their needs or timing. Things such ass mental issues, personal problems, and their work prefernce will always get in the way and he best thing to do is to work around it rather than forcing them to go. ";0
"First impressions can be deceiving, and sometimes it’s not until we know someone better that we realize their true character. Despite popular belief, these first impressions can be changed over time. 

One example of this comes from my own personal experience. My best friend in high school was someone I initially thought I had nothing in common with. We had completely different personalities and interests, so much so that we rarely shared a conversation, let alone became friends. Fast forward to college, and we’re now more like siblings than friends. Despite our different backgrounds – she was a first-generation immigrant from East Asia and I’m from a rural background halfway across the world – we’ve grown to understand each other and found areas of shared interest that have helped bond us closer than ever.

This is further supplemented by scientific evidence that supports the idea that first impressions can be changed. In a study conducted in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, it was found that one’s perception of another person can be modified with knowledge. This knowledge often comes in the form of connecting with shared interests or gaining a true understanding of the other person’s true character. This in turn allows for the development of a meaningful relationship that alters the initial perception of the other persons traits. 

In conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed. This is evident in my own personal experience, as well as in various scientific studies that have been conducted. Understanding the true character of a person or gaining an understanding of shared interests has the potential to change the perception of a first impression, allowing for a strong connection.";1
"As a student, one of the worst situations is one where an assignment is given that is unclear, vague, or otherwise difficult to understand. Completing projects is usually a laborsome enough activity on its own, but when the question or prompt is incomprehensible, it turns a small hill of a task into a mountain of one. Too many students have been in this situation and know what it is like to be immeasurably confused and frustrated because the assignment is too difficult to interpret. To make matters worse, students quite often do not know how to contact their teachers during the summer, so they are given no help or clarity as to what they are supposed to do. To avoid this, as well as a multitude of other issues, summer projects should be designed by the students, because they understand how to design the project to make it more ideal, it will allow the students to have more control over which direction the project is taken, and it would also benefit the teachers by stopping them from having to do even more work.

Different people can take different pieces of information away from the same things. Sometimes people will pick up on completely different parts of text than others would. This should not be an issue, but when a teacher is pushing for students to make a project from one angle or perspective, it could prove very restricting since they did not form the same viewpoint on the information. By designing their own projects, students could eliminate this obstacle and just create something based on what they took away from their learning. This would help students to be much more creative and would allow them to properly highlight what they learned. One could argue that this is counter intuitive since students would not all have the takeaway the teacher wants them to gain, but summer projects are once again just about assuring that students are learning and usually not followed up on as true assignments. The question of if a student learned the same thing as everyone else should not be as important as them just learning something relevant in general.

Giving students control over what they do for a summer project could greatly benefit their learning. By requiring them to design the project themselves, students are then also required to step up to the plate and be more responsible and creative. Learning to develop these characteristics is far more important than any history or science lesson their project may be on. As stated earlier, summer projects are usually not followed up on, making students even more likely to forget what they learned about from them. And at the very least, making the projects student-designed would save teachers from having to do it themselves, which they would most likely appreciate since they are already given enough work as is. ";0
"As an 8th grader, I have been given the task of researching the benefits and challenges of attending school compared to attending classes through online or video conferencing. At first, I thought it would be easy to just stick to the facts, but as I dug deeper, I realized that there are so many different perspectives and experiences to consider.

One of the biggest benefits of attending school is the social interaction and face-to-face communication with teachers and classmates. When you're in a physical classroom, you can read nonverbal cues and build relationships more easily. For example, my friend Sarah who took the option to attend classes online last semester noticed that she missed out on a lot of group work and class discussions. She felt like she was missing out on important learning opportunities.

On the other hand, some people might prefer online classes because they can work at their own pace and in their own space. This can be especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who have difficulty concentrating in a traditional classroom setting. For instance, my cousin Alex loves the flexibility of online classes because he can take breaks whenever he needs to and work on assignments whenever he wants.

Another important aspect to consider is the effect of attending school on students' mental and physical health. Research has shown that students who attend school regularly tend to have better mental health and well-being compared to those who don't. This is because school provides a structured routine and a sense of belonging, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling with anxiety or depression. However, attending school can also be physically demanding, especially for students who have to commute long distances or who have disabilities that make it difficult to navigate a traditional classroom.

I think it's important to consider the experiences of immigrant students who may face additional challenges when it comes to attending school. Many immigrant students may struggle with language barriers or cultural differences, which can make it harder for them to succeed in a traditional classroom setting. That's why programs like Esol (English for Speakers of Other Languages) are so important. These programs provide additional support and resources for immigrant students to help them succeed in school.

In conclusion, attending school has both benefits and challeng";1
"Principal:

I think that bring your phone to school and using them at lunch, break and other free times is a good idea. Because as long as they turn it off at the end of the time giving then there should be no problem. I know you probably think that people would go behind your back and leave there phones on but if they do and they get caught they should get in trouble for it. I really don't see a problem with taken your phone to school and using it at free time.

Also, if they don't obey the rules then they can pay the consequences.

Using phones at school is not no big deal if you think about it. Because we have eight hour in school and I think it is right if you let us use it when free time is giving to us, but not during class time. I know school means a lot but i still think we should get a free time and let us check our phones. School is not a joke, it is important i know that, but i bet you over half of the school checks there phones when they can.

In all, i think students should be allowed to use there phones when they have free time. Education is very important, but remember we have eight hours in school and I don't see any problem checking them at lunch, break or free time. i don't think its right sneaking behind your back and people trying to check there phone so instead of them going behind your back the free time giving to them they can check it.

"The debate over year-round school has been especially contentious in recent years. Supporters of year-round school argue that it provides students with more flexible scheduling, allowing them to take classes during regular summer months instead of having an extended December-March break. Additionally, they suggest that a continuous educational cycle supports learning and decreases the amount of time devoted to reviewing earlier material upon returning to school. 

Nevertheless, critics of year-round school contend that it results in teachers having greater workloads, since they are required to teach for more weeks each year. Other drawbacks include increased energy costs for schools that need to remain in operation during the summer months and decreased recreational opportunities for students who are occupied with school instead of enjoying summer activities with their classmates. 

Alternatives to year-round school include extending the traditional school day for traditional school years. Schools could also look into reapportioning the longer December-March break or shifting towards a four-day school week. Lastly, summer break offers students the opportunity to attain further academic progress and even available internships, as well as the chance to relax. Summer break allows students the opportunity to engage in activities that help them relax and view learning in a different light—which in turn can make learning more enjoyable.";1
"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I agree with the idea of students participating in sports activities unless they have a B average. I think this is a great idea because the students would be able to make it to college if they don't get a sports scholarship, the parents would be satisfied with the grade that their son or daughter gets, and the students would have a bright future because they would have a perfect reputation.

The first reason is that if the students have to get a B average in their grade that would make them desperate which would make the students smarter, which would get the students to pass the S.A.T test when they go to college, and if they do get into to college the school's reputation would better since the school changed the student's grade.

Also it would make the students easier to get them to college id they don't get a sports scholarship. Also the students would be happy to because they can play their favorite sports, and get a better grade, and good reputation that would follow the student untill they graduate college, which would make a good look when the people in the college looks at it, not like who got a bad grade since the councilors would hate the students before even meeting him.

Another reason why is that the parents would be satisfied with the work that their children has done, and their children would have a better reputation with sports. The parents would talk to their friends and tell them how great the school is, and their friends would tell their friends how good our school is and that could make this school a lot more popular then before.

The last reason is that the student's future would be right because the reputation can get a company to hire him with the reputation he had in his school years. Then many colleagues from the company might send their children to our school.

These are the reasons why I agree with the ideas, I hope that you will not change your mind about this reasons.

Thank You,

The Facial Action Coding System is a good technology but then again not. The software comes with alot of features but it could be a failure. Nobody could just guess someones emotions by looking at there face I dont think a computer sofware couldn't either. It possibly could find the emotions of someone but the results could be wrong because you never know what or how a person is feeling on the inside or outside. Most people don't express there feelings anyway so a computer sofware couldn't find it unless it has the best DNA sofware or best way to find how someones feeling on the inside. The Facial Action Coding System could be a failure in way of just having bad results if someones angry or depressed the software could determine that there happy or surprised. In the Mona Lisa picture she does look a little happy but thats one the inside it says it could find mixed emotions but she could be just smiling for the painting, Also in the instructions it gives you directions to smile or look happy. Maybe the software just tells your on the instructions to smile, so that the software could give you the results as your happy because of the directions of making you smile. The emotion software just gives you ways to smile maybe for you to smile so they can give you results as your happy or excited. In conclussion the Facial Action Coding System could be a failure and doesn't really work.;0
"Title: The Power of a Good Attitude: Unlocking Success and Happiness

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I've learned that having a good attitude can make a huge difference in our lives. It's like the old saying goes, ""Smile and the world smiles with you, cry and you cry alone."" But why is having a good attitude so important? In this essay, I'll explore the ways in which a good attitude can benefit a person's success, examine examples of when a good attitude has made a difference, and analyze the potential negative effects of having a good attitude all the time. I'll also discuss the importance of parents teaching children why attitude matters.

Body Paragraph 1: The Benefits of a Good Attitude
Research has shown that having a good attitude can lead to greater success in various areas of life. For instance, a positive attitude can help us to be more motivated, resilient, and creative. When we have a positive outlook, we're more likely to take risks and pursue our goals with confidence. This can lead to better grades, more opportunities, and a greater sense of fulfillment in our personal and professional lives.

Body Paragraph 2: Examples of a Good Attitude Making a Difference
There are countless examples of when a good attitude has made a real difference in someone's life. For example, my math teacher last year was always positive and encouraging, even when we were struggling with a difficult concept. Her attitude made me feel more motivated and excited to learn, and I ended up doing much better in the class than I expected. Similarly, my little sister has a great attitude towards her schoolwork and extracurricular activities, which has helped her to excel and make new friends.

Body Paragraph 3: The Potential Negative Effects of Having a Good Attitude
While having a good attitude can be incredibly beneficial, it's important to recognize that there can also be negative effects. For instance, if we're too optimistic all the time, we may not take things seriously enough or prepare adequately for challenges. This can lead to disappointment or failure when things don't go as planned. Additionally, having a good attitude can sometimes come across";1
"Have you ever gotten into a conflict with someone and you took into your own hands, but it didn't go too well?

Everyone gets into arguments, it's what make us humans. Most people have a mindset that says, ""it's either my way or the highway."" Having that way of thinking can be good in some cases, but in others not so much.

I believe that a person should take advice from others because it can help you see other perspectives, not take your own bias, and learn from the situation.

Seeing a different perspective on the situation is good because it tells you other ways of doing things that you never considered trying. Many people have probably been in that same situation and can tell you what they did. Hearing what other people have done can expand your mind into doing something totally different from what you were intending to do, which can be good. I remember a time where I was in a conflict with my friend, and didn't know how to handle it. I asked others to help me find a way to try getting my friend back, and they gave me some suggestions. Using their insight helped me get my friend back.

Not taking your own opinion is good because most of the time we think that we are always right. Which can make it hard to take others knowledge. Not taking your own bias can help by letting you break from your comfort zone, expanding into doing something you don't often do. For some, it's apologizing. When mutiple people tell you what they would've done it gives you any idea of what to do. Which can make it easier if you weren't too sure about your orginal one.

Learning from the situation is always better because it can help you grow as a person. For example, if someone gets into a fight with someone and they get suspended they learn that fighting others can result in a bad consequence. It's better to take the learning part with you throughout life because it can benefit you when others ask for your opinion on the same or a similar topic. As a result, you can get a more positive outcome, and less likely of a negative.

In conclusion, we should seek for mutiple opinons because it can benefit you in a more positive way. Seeking insight from others can be better for you by helping you see other perspectives, not taking your own bias, and learn from the situation. Others have different ways of thinking so taking a bit of that knowledge to better yourself for the future can be good. Not everyone thinks what you were intending to do would've turned out good, but that's just more of a reason to seek others opinions. ";0
"Some students need alternatives for learning and schools should be liable to provide them. Whether it's a class or just school in general, students should have options based on whichever way they learn the best. Some students just want to take online so they can use their resources while doing their work, others like it because it's the environment they are able to learn in the most efficiently in. In my opinion, it doesn't matter what reason they have to take the class. All that matters is the student is getting a better grade and learning more than the environment he or she was in. Of course they're people who need to be in a different environment because of medical or mental reasons; But this doesn't mean we shouldn't provide it for those who are struggling in a classroom environment.

Honestly I find this prompt ironic because this year is the first time i've taken an online class and i've been asked, ""isn't that for kids with special needs?"" ,and I find myself saying exactly what I wrote in the first paragraph! Since I am taking an online class I can safely say that it has helped me. The reason I took my class online (History) is because the classroom I was in was very hectic. I am in honors and that is one of the only honors classes I am taking so I didn't want the reason for me dropping out of honors to be my teacher/class, and that's when I thought about online class. Instead of dropping the class I was able to still take honors online and my grade went from a C to an A. On top of that, I have more fun being in this class so it makes me wanna learn. I truly believe that I can learn more in a week of online class than I would a year of History with Generic_Name. It's not that he's a bad teacher, once again, it's just that environment isn't for me.

I believe that schools should feel obligated to provide an alternative for student's education. In my opinion, the evidence speaks for itself. Would you rather spend a year wasting your time in a class that you might fail because it isn't the way you learn, or would you rather spend 8 months in a class that you'll have fun in and retain the information for the rest of your life? Duh, the one you'll do bad in.(sarcasm) Schools already provide alternatives for a lot of kids, but mostly for people who need it (medical reasons). But that doesn't mean the students who are struggling in ordinary environments don't ""need"" it too.

I didn't know how to indent so I used spaces.";0
"Have you ever become ill during school days? Perhaps you felt anxious to go to school? Even wanting to learn at home than school itself? If you answered yes to any of these questions than distance learning would be most beneficial for you. Distance learning is now an option for some schools for students to attend classes from home by the form of online or video conferencing. Simply imagine being able to partake in your education at the luxury of your home. Distance learning would be beneficial to students who are rather sick, socially anxious, and eager to learn as they will be able to attend classes at home with no harm.

If you are ever feeling ill, you most definitely do not want to attend school as you are not feeling well and you could cause your fellow peers to become ill as well. When you do not attend school, however, you are missing out on a lot of quality learning. You may certainly be able to pick up the assignments you had in class, but doing them on your own may prove to be rather difficult. Thanks to distance learning, you are now able to attend classes that may support you in your education in a lot of different ways compared to not having any learning at all. When you learn at home when you are ill you do not have to worry about causing harm to your peers and your humble abode is a place where you can feel safe and comfortable. Illness can be many different things but no matter what it is it may be better for you to stay at home. In fact, you are most likely to be better supported at home as you can consume whatever food or medicine you need to make yourself feel better while learning something that will benefit you. I can recall many times when I was ill and I just sat at home doing nothing when I could actually be doing something through distance learning. The vast majority of individuals can agree that something is better than nothing.

Social anxiety is rather common among students, especially with teenagers across the country. Sometimes you just do not have the mentality to communicate with your peers effectively or you want to be alone due to other factors that may be causing your social anxiety. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of resources for these students to access or they are simply too scared to access them. Personally, I have felt this in days where I did not want to go to school at all due to bullying, peer pressure, and more. Students who feel anxious when going to school are typically fine in every other regard. With distance learning, these students are truly able to take the great opportunity of attending classes at home. Your education should not be at stake due to social anxiety, and this option changes that for the better.

Those eager students that are academically successful may find this opportunity to be quite useful as well. You see, it is quite possible for students to attend their classes both at school and at home. This is beneficial to those who seek to advance within their path to graduation. For example, I did something similar with Virtual Loudoun, a program that allows you to take courses online for many reasons, one of them being to advance at an accelerated rate. There is also the high possibility that students may find their classes at school going to slow or being too easy. Through distance learning, you are able to work at your own pace as there is not a group of students needing to be helped or you are waiting on to continue a lesson.

It is truthfully a marvelous thing for schools to offer such an excellent option to students who may need it or simply wish to have those great benefits. Whether you are ill, have social anxiety, or simply wanting to learn more, distance learning is beneficial towards you and many other groups. It is a shame that many schools do not offer distance learning as they are doing a disservice by not allowing students to have these benefits that other schools are offering. Students should make their voices be heard and call for schools who do not offer distance learning to immediately offer the option due to its great benefits. There is no doubt in my mind that any student body would not want this option being available to them. You should also call for schools to offer this as an option, as anyone can request for it to happen. If you don't, you are letting all of these great benefits that should be offered not exist to students that genuinely need them. Take the time to stand for what you need, it will only take you minutes to grant you hours of quality education.";0
"Ugh, I don't know if I really want to write about this. I mean, technology is cool and all, but I don't think it's taking over my life in a good way. Here are some reasons why I think we should use it less:

First of all, technology is making us way too dependent on it. Like, I can't even remember the last time I didn't have my phone in my hand. It's like, I need it to survive or something. And don't even get me started on social media. I feel like I'm constantly checking my Instagram and Snapchat, even though I know I shouldn't be. It's like, I'm addicted or something.

Secondly, technology is taking away our privacy. Like, I know I'm not supposed to be on my phone during dinner, but I can't help it. My parents are always on my case about it, but I just can't help myself. And it's not just my phone, it's like, all of these apps and websites are tracking my every move and selling my info to who knows who. It's like, I don't even know who I am anymore.

Thirdly, technology is making us way too isolated. Like, I know I'm supposed to be hanging out with my friends, but I'd rather just stay home and play video games. And don't even get me started on online gaming. It's like, I'm in a whole different world and I forget about everything else. It's like, I'm not even in my own body anymore.

Fourthly, technology is making us way too lazy. Like, I know I'm supposed to be doing my homework, but I'd rather just search for answers on Google. And don't even get me started on how much time I waste on YouTube. It's like, I could watch videos all day long and not even realize it. It's like, I'm not even learning anything.

Lastly, technology is making us way too distracted. Like, I know I'm supposed to be paying attention in class, but I can't help it. My phone keeps buzzing and I have";1
"At first, the idea of not using a car may seem like an extreme inconvience that comes with endless problems. However after looking into the matter there are many hidden advantages. One can lessen emmissions, and help create a less polluted enviornment for themselves. One may also be able to save money by simply taking alternate types of transportation.

By using a car less, one can help decrease the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Paragraph five by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states that up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are due to passenger cars. While these numbers may seem daunting, some cities have reduced their pollution in simple ways. For example, Paris experienced record breaking air pollution caused by emissions. This drove leaders to put in place a ban on certain cars driving during specific days of the week. Not only did the smog clear within one day, but sixty percent of car traffic was down too. If Paris'es problem was fixed by making a simple switch, then less polluted cities could easily decrease their emissions aswell.

One can also save money by avioding cars. Not only are cars expensive in the first place, but as explained by Rosenthal in paragraph twenty nine, the bridge and tunnel tolls are rising. Bikes on the other hand, are a great alternative because they are inexpensive and they have free paths. One may argue that it is impossible to get the public to ditch their cars for human powered machinces, but in Bogota, colombia, this is already happening. For one day each year cars are banned, and only certaing types of vehicles are allowed. Selsky explains in paragraph twenty that millions participated, even on rainy days. Here one can see that this alternative transportation idea is not a couple of people, but a widespread movement.

Overall, lessening ones usage of cars has many benefits. Not only can one help ensure cleaner air, but they can save money while their at it. By making small changes in ones everyday life, huge impacts can be made on the community.    ";0
"Sometimes I find myself stuck and confused over some of the smallest things. Typically I am debating over which decision would lead to the best outcome. I strongly believe that having many peoples opinions to consider is always helpful. Asking more experienced people, having good and bad things to think about , and getting many different opinions are all ways to make decision making easier.

When it comes to asking people for advice, most of the time the more advice I get, the better. Having multiple opinions to think about is better than just one. There are many pros and cons for everything and asking many people for advice will help to point those pros and cons out. When I have everyone's advice to think about, it allows me to think about all of the good and bad things that could happen based on the choice I make.

In addition to that, talking to many people for advice on something helps me see from their point of view. Sometimes I don't realize how big or small the situation I'm in actually is. When I take a moment to look at the situation from a different prospective, it helps me to be more open minded. Sometimes we all get so distracted and don't realize how much our decisions could affect others. Taking a moment to see something from someone else's point of view wouldn't be such a bad idea.

Not only should we ask others for advice, but asking others who happen to be experienced is never a bad idea. Some people specialize in certain topics and asking someone who knows a lot about something could be very beneficial. Many times I have asked my older brother for help with things like my phone or the television, because when it comes to technology he has always been very helpful. Often times adults are the best people to ask for advice from because they are very experienced at life.

In conclusion, I believe that asking for advice from many people will always help. Also asking more than one person and seeking many different opinions to help make the best choice is always a good idea. It's never a bad idea to rethink choices based on other peoples advice.";0
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Some people ask more than one person for there advice, so they can weight there options. The advice I go to my friends for are Clothes, Nail Polish, and Hair. Those are just a couple but those are the major ones.

The first reason I go to my friends for advice is Clothes. Some clothes are cute but some are to cropped for me. I ask my friends if this would look good on me. Some of the stuff does but, some doesn't. Also if my clothes match. I send them the outfit that I am wearing and get there opinions. most of the time my clothes match. It is just when I am unsure about it matching that I send it to them.

Another reason I go to my friends for advice is Nail Polish. Nail Polish is hard to pick from because they have so many beautiful colors. When I am choosing I send the colors that I like the most and the glitter, if I am feeling a glitter that day,. After I send them, they text me the ones they like and then I choose between those that they choose, or the ones that got choose the most. once i have them then i try then out on a piece of my finger so then i will know if they are darken then the bottle says or litter. On another piece of that same finger nail i make sure the Nail Polishes look good together.

The final reason I go to my friends for advice is Hair. I ask this question a lot, if my hair looks good ?. The reason I do that is because I try new hair styles, and I wear them to school so i ask people if I look good with it.

For example, I learned how to french braid and i wore it to school. All day people were asking me to do there hair. so i guess it looked good.

My conclusion is that when people ask for advice you should answer it and help them out. I help people out when they come to me. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. If you are that person then you are a important person to them. These are just a couple of the things I go my friends for but when I do they are happy because they got to help out one of there friends with advice. The advice I go to my friends for are clothes, nail polish, and hair. Those are only a couple but the major ones.  ";0
"Title

Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving, for the reason that the use of a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle is exceedingly hazardous for the driver, as well as others who are traveling along the same road. The use of mobile devices while on the road leads to distracted driving which means that the driver is less likely to notice road and safety signals, Pedestrians and the signals coming from other vehicles. Failure to heed these signals has led to injuries and death that could have been prevented had the driver not been using a mobile device while on the wheel. In the U.S., there are laws banning the use of mobile devices or the act of texting while someone is on the wheel.

The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high and can pose serious safety risks. You can be charged with murder for texting and driving. Texting is the most alarming distraction sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for a couple of seconds. Using a cellphone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on

U.S. roads. In 2017 alone 3,166 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes including distracted drivers. Texting and driving is against the law (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving"").

In an effort to fight these problems, more than 30 states now have a law when it comes to texting and driving(""The Risks of Texting While Driving""). The penalties for texting while driving could include hefty fines, license suspension, a rise in auto insurance rates, and prison time. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another of the most serious driving offenses. (DUI) sometimes drivers who keep on texting do not see any people or animals crossing the street so there is a tendency to hit somebody crossing the road. Texting while driving is bad because it can bring fatal damages towards life. It may ruin the lives of others or worse might cause your life to end. Texting is a huge distraction to all drivers. Numerous drivers do not take this life threatening habit seriously and try to argue that these are an exception to these rules.

Texting may be useful, but the use of it can also be very bad. You can not keep both hands on the wheel so accidents may occur. It may put you at greater risk because you fail to see important road signs and signals. Sometimes a stressful text can provoke anger, which might affect your driving behavior. Texting while driving is a horrible idea because you need to look at the phone as you type and read incoming text messages. The vehicle might run over hole or wrong rails which might lead to car accidents. Texting while driving is dangerous and does kill, and has many times. Using a cell phone particularly texting while driving requires the driver to turn his mental attention to the device manipulate it with his hand to look at it.

Texting and driving should be banned because it is a hazard, and is an alert that needs to be reduced. The first reason for texting or using a cell phone while driving is very hazardous to yourself and the people surrounding you. Texting and driving is the act of composing, sending, reading text messages, emails or making similar use of the web on a mobile device while operating a motor vehicle. Texting while driving is considered extremely dangerous by many people, including authorities and in some places have either been outlawed or restricted. No one should text and drive. Be an example for others and if you need to text or talk on the phone, pull over to a safe place. Set rules for yourself and your household regarding texting and driving, lead by example. Currently there is no national ban on texting or using a wireless phone while driving, but a number of states passed laws banning texting or wireless phones requiring hands-free use of wireless phones while driving.

"In "" The Chellenge of Exploring Venus"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a wrthy persuit despite the dangers. Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase humans curiosity likely led us into many equally intimidating eneavors

One hink tha the author suggests that stufying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dengers it presents, is that many mission was unmannned and for good reason, since not spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

Another reason that the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers, is that. Aa thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more Challengingare the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 greater that what we experience on our own planet.

In conclusion studying Venus is dangerous, because the weather is too much for us; there are temperatures that our body can't support or recist. Also Venus is not touched down in more than three decades, so that can be very dngerous for humans to experiment Venus.";0
"Dear Principal,

Most people feel good when they help other people, and they do it as often as they can. They might be a volunteer at a soup kitchen, donate money, pick up litter, help someone put up their groceries, or any other community service. Volunteering is a great way to help the community and anyone can do it, however volunteering is called volunteering for a reason. When you volunteer, you're willing to give up your time to help someone else. You shouldn't force someone to volunteer for community service. Volunteering is a choice. That's why it's called ""volunteer.""

Some people might want to help out, but they don't have time. They could have a job after school, plus have to do all of the homework required by your teachers. If you force students to perform a service, they might not be able to reach there highest point academically because they're so bogged down with a to-do list. Students would get too stressed out with everything they have to do. Stress isn't good physically or mentally, and that could cause grades to go down. Not having to do community service would give students more time for studying and other things like an after-school sport or club. If you want more kids to participate in extra-curricular things, you can't add another burden onto their shoulders. You know what they say, All work and no play...

Helping out the community is very important, but community service isn't the only way for a person to help out in the community. Most people recycle, or donate old clothes to a local charity. A recent survey showed that starting a recycling or donating program at our school would have a lot more willing participants than required community service would. In fact, 90% of the student population said they would love to help out with my proposed programs, whereas only 40% would be willing to volunteer for a service. Donating and recycling, or another idea you may have that's easy do to and doesn't take too much time, would be just as helpful to the community as volunteer work would be.

People who have the time for volunteering can and will do it on their own. I would encourage students to take part in community service, but sometimes, people just don't have the ability to. There is no need for you to require community service in our school. Don't force students to be a volunteer, because then it just wouldn't be volunteering. They wouldn't be as willing to do the service, and they might not do the job as well as they would if they did it by choice, and the community service would be a waste of time if the helper didn't do it right or well enough. That's just common sense. Please consider my suggestions, and thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

Your Student,

"The reason people seek mutiple advice, it can be different tips, some might seek other help, and may benefit you in certain ways for your personal life style.

FIrst taking tips frim other people may help you through out life and may help you learn a different style. For instance, when playing basketball you might have to take some tips from your coach. When on certain plays if your running the play and its not benfiting your team you can ask for a better way to make the play succesful. And may be a way you be able to become a pro at that style of coaching you have got taught.

Second another reason people talk to more than one person is cause you might learn a different way. For example like you might be asking visual person how to explain something and they can't cause they learn by someone showing, them how to do it and you learn by somebody telling you or explaining how to do that particular thing.

Or they might know have taken the course you took in high school or college or may be talented in that work of field, or sport, job etc.

Last but not least personal life style is very important for you at a young age to learn a little bit about the changes, you that he or she might go though and you may need to talk to your mom or dad about when it is the right time or bring it up if yall on that topic. Maybe be about how to find a good house and the connection to people that your parents know that help get an deal on your first car, furniture, clothes, bills, and other personal questions you might .

However the might be good reason and all but not all you will most people might know ho to do this teach they self and some of us are independent im not saying its bad to be dependent on some things but you don't people to use you get you in trouble or can get in some mess with the law. And it will mess yo up expesically if you do sports if you get to big league like the Nba, Nfl,Mlb,Fifa you can get suspended sued have to pay a fine if you do something may get in trouble for smoking or being in some drive by dont just hang around people that gonna miss lead you hang around the people that's gonna lead yo in the right way .

My Conclusion is that it is helpful for asking for different people opinion but don't get the wrong perspective on certain things like if he or she needs to know about there bidy changes then ask your parents, or if you want to know about a certain thing abiut the field you then ask a friend you can trust or a family member you can trust about that particular thing you want to do, or a coach about certain way sto get better at what your set your goal to get there and that my conclusion sincerely eric  ";0
"One of the advantages of getting rid of cars is traffic. Cars is a major isssue because mostly in the mornings people are tryin to get from one place to another at the same time. This action causes Death,car wrecks,etc. Bogota colombia- In aprogram  thtas set to spread to other countries millions of colombians hiked,biked,skated or took buses during a car free day to avoid traffic jams.

Another cars is a bad idea is because of its gas. When people drive or even crank their cars that gac or diesel is goin up into the air causing  our air to become filthy ans cloudy. Diesel or gas is dangerous because it harms the air, people, animals and other things. For example ''It's a good opportunity to take awat stress and lower air pollution'';said business man Carlos Arturo plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife.

But a good thin about this article is that it says that president obama's ambitious goals to curb the united states ' greenhouse gas emissions unveiled last week will get a fortuitous assist. So basically wat it is trying to say is that eventually a end to cars will come. Since 2005  the number of miles drive have dropped steadily after. over the years people have stooped relying on cars.

As april 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and eqyal to where the country was in 1995. Me myself personally think that people should stop driving cars and start walking or using bikes thats one reason why people are becoming obese because they are relying on cars to get them everywhere they need to go. Just imagine that cars were never invented i bet there would be fewer people who would be obese than there is now.

So overall people should stop relying on cars to get them where they need to and depend on themselves because eventually the end to cars will come. Look at it this way if people would stop using there cars to go everywhere there would be fewer accidents and less funerals. and our air would be clear no more cloudy atmosphere. so all i can say is cars will become EXTINCT.

"Multiple advises greater than one

Isn't multiple opinions greater than just one? People may want to only hear one response, but usually it's not the right one, finding different options and opinions from different people will help you make the best choice. Seeking multiple opinions can be much more helpful then one because others might have different perspectives, advice they can give, and you'll have less doubts on making a decision.

Different perspectives from different people can always be better than only hearing one out and it can help you make a decision. Many people need help on figuring out a decision and can't just count on one person for help they need to hear it from another perspective. I always find it best to ask many people for opinions so I can see it through them and what they think. Getting help to make a right choice might just need you to find the right person that truly cares to help you. When I'm looking for someone to help me I always know to find friends and family members I can trust. I think if you can't figure out the problem out on your own then maybe friends can help you in a way to make it better. I sometimes talk to friends and we always help each other out by talking it through putting it in a way so we all can understand each other. There are different ways to find different perspectives that can help a someone see it in a different way to understand.

When people give you advice it can help to fix the situation. Sometimes you can't figure out what to do in a situation but if your asking someone for help they could give you some advice that can help you through it. When I'm at school and need some advice on how to get better in math my teacher or friend can give me options that will help me get better. Also, for people going through a hard time they can get some advice from friends to speak to a counselor or just ask help from their parents. If I every see someone going through a hard time I like to help by giving advice and letting them know that maybe they could talk to a counselor or a trusted adult. Sometimes you may be stuck in a situation where you want to play a sport but are afraid but, finding different people too help you by giving there experience playing a sport can help you not to be afraid. When I played a sport at first I didn't know what it was gonna be like but people that already played the sport soccer gave me advice so it has helped me to now love soccer. Sometimes you don't know ways to fix your situation but finding help from others to give you advice and it will help you a lot.

Seeking multiple opinions can give you less doubts on a decision your making. This is because finding the help of others makes you have less doubt in a situation where you have to make a decision. I have been in a place where I had doubts on if could do well on a hard test but having others give you help believe in yourself makes it way better. When there's someone that gives you the time and helps you find ways to make things better and gives you courage and hope it can also make you have less doubts. Whenever my mom tells me I can do it and when others believe in me I feel so much more confident and doubtless. We might not be able to do something when we are confused but when we have support from others not just one person but more than one that can help you lose all your doubts. I feel that one person may not just be able to help me but asking for others to help me to is so much greater than one. Feeling doubtful can be hard but there will always be many people that can help you through the hard times.

Seeking multiple opinions can make someone make a good choice because of having different perspectives from others, getting advice from others, and having less doubts on making a decision. By having perspectives from other people you can see things in a different way and having advice can help you find ways to fix what's going on and this helps you to have less doubts to make decisions. I believe finding multiple opinions are much better than just one from one person because just hearing one person won't help you as much as asking many people so you have different thoughts and ways to make a good decision.                   ";0

"Deciding whether or not to allow students to use or carry their phones around in school is really hard to decide. I think they should allow students to use their phones during all the free time they have, but that they should be turned off during class time. Having at least some time to use your phone is a lot better than not having it at all. Concentration is a big factor of this policy. Sometimes you just have to communicate with certain people sometimes, which is one of the things that really makes me agree with this policy.

Having some time to use your phone is better than not being allowed to use it at all. I am a strong believer that kids should be able to use their phones at least during their free time during school. The only time students have to relax for a little while during school hours is lunch, and they don't really have the freedom to do what they please, especially if they are going to be playing around. I think that if students are given the opportunity to use their phones during lets say, lunch hours, then they will be at least a little less hyper or uncontrollable.

I believe the only reason why i agree with the section of the policy that states that their phones have to be turned off during class time is the concentration issue. I know, because I see it all the time, if you give students permission to use their cell phones when ever they please, they will take advantage, and they will use the phone during all class time. In my opinion, having a phone at you reach and being allowed to use it is a temptation no one can resist. It is guaranteed that if you give a phone to a student, and you tell that student that they can use the phone when ever they please, they will be using it 24/7. Maybe if you tell that student that they are allowed to use their phone during all their free time, but not during class time, most will follow instructions.

Students should always be carrying their phones, even if they are turned off, mainly because of emergencies. In middle school, students are no longer allowed to go around the hallways with a friend, but that is exactly why they should have some type of communication with someone else, in case something happens. When a parent wants to communicate with their child as soon as possible, or vise-versa, they are obviously going to do it through they child's phone, even though they both know that it is not supposed to be done this way. During emergencies, like the killings there have been in schools, the way that the students have been able to communicate with their families or with the police was through their mobile devices. Your cell phone can literally save your life, and the ones of others.

I think that this policy should be put in use all over the country because it is better to have your phone for a while and not for it to be prohibited, it is a great way for kids to have good concentration during class time, and for them to communicate when it is needed. If i were a school principal, i would immediately agree with this policy and i would implement it. Students would be perfectly ok with having to have their phones turned off during a period of time that isn't too long.";0
"I agree that all students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

I agree with this because extracurricular activities will help students physical health.

Extracurricular activities will help with students mental health.

And extracurricular activities will help with students socially.

In my opinion, extracurricular activities have only positive aspects.

First, physical health will be improved if all students are made to do a extracurricular activity.

Students that choose to do a sport will have to exercise with their team and will have to go to the games and practices.

Students that do extracurricular activities are generally more productive than students that don't do one.

Also, students will have to exercise with their teams and won't be able to procrastinate.

Extracurricular activities will only improve students physical health and will not make them any unhealthier.

Secondly, students mental health will be improved if they're are made to do an extracurricular activity.

When you are doing something your brain is always exercising.

Students that have a strong physical health generally have a strong mental health.

However, this is not always the case.

When you are part of a group you all feel like you're a family, causing you to feel like your part of something.

When your brain is being made to exercise there are no negatives to it, there are only positives.

Finally, being part of an extracurricular activity will make you feel better socially.

When the people that you spend the most time with are your friends you become closer.

You can also make new friends and meet new people that have the same interest as you.

You will be exercising with your friends which will only make your relationship with them healthier.

In my opinion, being in an extracurricular activity can only make you and the people you are surrounded by more social.

Extracurricular activities have many positives towards helping teenagers in their life.

However, there can be some negatives towards extracurricular activities such as getting injured, or not being able to hangout with people.

But all of these reasons are just part of life and I believe that all teenagers need to be exposed to what will happen to them in the real world.        ";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME:

With all of the homework and projects students get today we don't have time for what we want to do, so why should we be wasting our time with community service. I am not saying it is a bad thing I wish I could go help out at the humane society or something but I'm usually up tell nine, ten o'clock doing homework. So students even haft to drop sports because there is a lot of homework. I am one example I have homework tell nine forty-five or ten o'clock. I've also dropped bowling on Mondays because of all of the homework. If you were to add community service to me to do list I wouldn't ever have any tome to spend with family, friends, and pets, I would be doing the community service on my well deserved weekend when all I want to do is sleep, play video game, and most importantly skateboard which I can't do thank to homework. It is crazy how many hours on stuff the school is making us do, please, I ask you not to add community service to the list of things to do, all you will end up with is students not liking you and angry parents because their child was up tell midnight doing homework.

"Limiting car usage could make americans daily life alot better. Americans have always relied on a automobile for there means of transpertatio n but if we limited our automobile use our lfe's would get alot better. Other countries are doing it and there getting positive outcomes. So should we follow other countires in there no car days or car ban?

In Vauban, Germany the community is completely car free. its a experimental district that does not allow the ownership of a car, 70 percent of familes in Vaubans do not own cars 57 percent sold a care to move to Vauban. Heidrum Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""by elimanting the use of cars this community is less stressful of traffic and has reduced emmisions.

If us as Americans used bikes or walked or took the buses to our destination, pollution and smog would decrease. In Paris a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. After 2 days of the car ban the sog cleared up. Imagine if we did that here in the united states polution would go down drasticaly.

And if we stoped driving cars for a few days every week there would be lesser car accidents every year. people would have to walk to there destination or ride a bike and people would get exercise from the walking or riding the bike. We would spend less money on gasoline or desiel.

Americans car use is already have starting to decrease since 2005, If the pattern persists it will have benefial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. So many good thigs come from using cars less and if we start following the trend our lifes and communities will soon improve.    ";0
"Students can feel various different types of emotions throughout the school day. School can be very stressful and overwhelming yet so enjoyable at the same time. When students are feeling a certain way, it may affect their ablity to learn. By incorporating the use of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom, teachers or even the computers themsleves could alter the learning style of the information being taught, making it customized and fitting for a specific student based on their emotions.

Everyone is different when it comes to learning. Some students may be visual learners where as some students may be auditory learners. There are numerous, unique differences spanning from individual to indivdual which makes it hard on teachers when trying to teach a group of students the same material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System would make the job easier on teachers and prove helpful for students. For example, if a teacher could not visually recognize that one of thier students was tired, they may continue on with the way they are teaching the information, and that particular student may not grasp the concept being taught. With the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would be able to recognize the students emotions and would have the opprotunity to alter her teaching method to somehting more engaging for the student. This would also prove helpful for the student that was feeling tired becasue they would now be able to become engaged with a modified style of learning.

If the Facial Action Coding System recognized that the students appeared to be happy and engaged, this could guide the teacher to continue teaching in that particular style and it would benefit the students trying to learn. Another way that this new technology could prove valuble in the classroom is if students were doing work on their computer or other elctronic device. If the Facial Action Coding System was installed into the learning devices that the students are using, the device itself could alter the learning style of the information given to fit the students needs. Even Dr. Haung, a professor at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Huang).

The Facial Action Coding System would prove to be valube and helpful in many ways when incorporated in the classroom. The use of this technology would allow teachers and electronic teaching devices to enhance their learning styles to attend to all different types of students. Often times teachers forget that some individuals learn differently than others and only focus thier course in one direction. This new form of technology could serve as a reminder to teachers that students vary in learning styles but could also account for those differences among students.    ";0
"Hey there!  So, you know how sometimes you meet someone new and you just know if you're gonna be BFFs or not?  Yeah, first impressions are a real thing, man. They can totally make or break a relationship.

Like, think about it. When you first meet someone, you're like, judging them based on how they look, how they talk, and what they say. And if you don't like what you see, well, it's kinda hard to forget it.  It's like, your brain is like, ""Hmm, this person is kinda weird, I don't wanna hang out with them."" And then you don't, and the whole thing falls apart. 

But, on the other hand, if you have a good first impression, it's like, everything is rainbows and unicorns!  You're like, ""Oh my gosh, this person is so cool! I wanna hang out with them all the time!"" And then you do, and it's like, the best thing ever. 

I mean, think about it. Have you ever met someone who was like, super nice and friendly, but then you found out they were actually kinda mean or something?  It's like, whoa, first impressions are important, man. They can tell you a lot about a person.

And it's not just with people, either.  Like, think about how you first saw this classroom. Did you like it? Or did you think it was, like, super lame?  I mean, I personally think it's pretty cool, but I'm sure some people might not agree. 

Anyway, my point is, first impressions are a big deal. They can make or break relationships, and they can even affect how you feel about a place or thing. So, next time you meet someone new or walk into a new space, try to be aware of your first impression. You never know, it might just change everything! 

Oh, and one more thing.";1
"Going to school back and forth can be exhausting and inconvenient so wouldnt distance learning be a decent alternative? No, distance learning would not benefit the student because it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships, the courses would change, and it would be easier to become distracted during schoolwork.

My first reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships. For example in my own life I have made some of my best friends through the public school system. In third grade I met a kid named Generic_Name and over the years because we went to the same school we became close friends and he even hooked me up with a job last summer. In seventh grade I had a less than desirable English teacher whose monotone voice made him sound like he came straight out of a charlie brown cartoon. Because of him I met a guy named Generic_Name who I quickly befriended because our shared hate toward our English teacher, and now I get a free movie sometimes when Generic_Name is on staff at the Regal movie theater, who I never would have meet if we didnt go to the same school. On the other hand there are people that believe it is possible to be connected and make new relationships online, and even though it is possible to do so their reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is always easier to make new relationships through face to face physical contact. Someone who exemplifies this fact perfectly is my friend Generic_Name who I met in middle school. In middle school Generic_Name was my best friend, but this changed when she moved and her parents decided to have her take an online schooling program. While she does well in the course she has told me that she misses going to a physical school where she can actually see people because it is harder to make friends due to the nature of the online course and because of the online course whenever I do get to see her she is way more socially awkward than she used to be. All in all distance schooling not only makes it more difficult to make meaningful relationships but because of the lack of those meaningful relationships it makes it even more difficult to learn the intricacies of social interaction.

Another reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that the nature of the courses that we take would change for the worse. For example In my ninth grade biology class we had to dissect a frog and organize it's organs. During the assignment I learned more about that frog than I could anywhere else because of the hands on nature of the assignment. This just goes to show that if we started using distance learning courses they would miss out on the hands on portion of learning. On the other side of the argument there are those that believe the hands on portion of learning is not very important, and that might apply for some people however buy in large the hands on part is extremely important due to the fact that everyone learns differently whether it be auditory, visual, or hands on. Someone who demonstrates this fact excellently is my friend Generic_Name. I met Generic_Name sophomore of high school in my chemistry class, and during this class we were given a lot of lab assignments with a paper packet to go with it. During these assignments I would understand most of the work given to us while Generic_Name was a little more lost, and while I tried to help him through the packet he could never fully contemplate the complex design of the stapled pieces of paper, but this all changed once we got to the hands on section. As soon as we got to the hands on portion of whatever lab we were doing it was almost as if he was a completely different person, I would stand back and watch in awe as he took perfect measurements, solving complicated math equations, and just dominating the lab overall. So in the end distance learning would not only take away amazing hands on activities but by doing so would prevent us from learning how we learn whether it be Auditory, Visual, or hands on.

My last reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that it would make it even easier to be distracted from working. For example whenever I am at home doing my math homework and I am getting particularly bored with it it is very easy to ""take a quick break"". This could mean anything from a two minute glass of water or a five hour nap depending on how I am feeling. So if I took a online course I would have to face this same dilemma with every assignment I am given. On the other side of the fence there are some people that believe that they are very studious and would never have a problem like this. While I get where they are coming from, their reasoning is still wrong because even if they are the most studious person in the world that temptation to become distracted will still always be there. Someone who demonstrates this perfectly is my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name is probably one of the most hard working people I have ever known, not only does he take high level courses for his age but he also does track all while being home schooled. Not only will he deny every offer of a hangout but he will also stay up way later than he should just to finish his latest assignment, but even though he does all of these things I will occasionally catch him logging into Minecraft when I know he shouldnt be, and because of this he usually has awful time management skills. This just goes to show how distance learning not only makes it easier to become distracted because of how convenient it is but also how it enforces bad study habits because of the lack of a classroom.

Distance learning in theory is a great idea because of how convenient it is, but the main reason why distance learning would not benefit students is because of how convenient it is. So to sum up schools should stay the way they are and not offer any distance courses because of how it would change what we are able to learn.";0

In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around.  You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk.  It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles.  If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution.

It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to ""give up"" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house.  In Vauban,Germany, this ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area.  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and media trainer.  70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.  The town is not completely ""car free,"" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg.  Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way.

Smog is a big problem in Paris,France.  After several days of ""near-record pollution,"" Paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air.  About 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine.  The fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.  The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France.  The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted.           ";0
"Peple think that the only way of transportation is by car, well that isn't true. There are many ways in which you can go from A to B without a car. The people have gotten to depenent on cars and it just can't be that way because the gas used to power the cars are whats causing so much pollution and we need to stop that.

For places like china that has the most population in the world since a lot of poeple use cars over there, it made china the most polluted country in the world, which is never good pollution can cause serious problem that we the people do not want. All people have to do drive less and walk more or just drive less you don't even need to walk, but the less we drive the less polluted our world can be the better it is. People in Europe who live in Vauban, Germany which is a suburbed area, most of the people there dont use cars; 70 percent of the families that live in Vauban do not use cars and 57 percent of the 70 should there cars to move there. A population of 5,500 people, more than half of them dont use cars; now that sounds crazy but it works the area is less polluted and that life style is being adopted around the world in attempts to see if we the people can be less dependent on our cars and use them less.

Places like paris have banned driving because of to much smog in the air, and people who cantinued to drive got fined for 22-euros ($31) and more than 4,000 drivers got fined and there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Also in places like Bogota, Colombia they have a day were people are not allowed to use there cars besides buses and taxis and violaters were to face a $25 fine. That helped promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Other columbian cities have also adpoted this no car free day and are using it to also help with smog.

People do not need to stop driving all around but we need to start driving less to prevent smog and pollution, the less we drive the less polluted our world is, and it takes everyone to do that. In the United states there is a study were every year less people are driving and getting there liscens and that right there is a start. We the people must realize that we can not depened on car to much there are many alternitive ways of transportation we just need to learn to use those ways instead of cars.    ";0
"I personally think that completely driveless cars are a bad idea. As a 16 year old, I'm finally the legal age to receive my licenses, but I can't receive my licenses if I don't have a car to drive. With driveless cars, we are literally allowing cars to think for us.

If driveless cars do become the new thing to have, what would the driver do? The driver would simply stop paying attention to the road, and the car would do everything for them. With the car doing everything for them, more drivers would focus their energy and attention somewhere else, causing more accidents. With more accidents, who would be at fault? Would it be the driver, or the company?

How will the laws be made in order to keep others safe if the car happens to break down? With actuall drivers driving a car their attention, and energy is on the road they're driving on. If they do cause an accident, there's cars that are made to prevent an accident before it happens.

Being able to drive a car is a privilege, and with driveless cars, we're taking that privilege away for others who have waited so long to be able to drive.    ";0
"I think driverless cars will be a good invention for the future. I don't think we will have to pass a driver's test to get to drive one. This will save time out of our days that we spend studying and practicing to pass those permits and tests. Although these cars aren't completely driverless yet, I believe we will get there soon and our progress on it is fascinating. ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents.""

Driverless cars have been thought of since around the late 1950's, it's just people or companies didnt have the technology, we have today, to make them. The cars also save money spent on gas and repairs. The article says, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

To conclude, yes I believe driverless cars are the way to the future. They will benefit us more than they will do harm, if any. Many companies have already started building their own edition of driverless cars. BMW have cars that steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but even they sill need driver's assistance. And what about the driver's laws, will you have to be 18 to get one of these futuristic cars, or will there even be an age limit since the driver won't do anything? "" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day.""";0
"Dear, Principal

I agree with the first policy. I agree because i think that it is a fair deal that students can bring their cell phones but they have to turn them off during classes. It is fair because teachers wont get mad and complain about us using our cell phones in classes. I understand that it can cause a big problem on our free time but where i come from in my mind is that what if something happen to us or to the school. Teachers cant watch all of the children they don't know what will happen. All the teachers cant let all the children use their phone if its an emergency because i would believe that its over 200 students in the school that we are in. That is why i think we should be allowed to have phones and if we have free time you will think you can never get our attention if we are on our phones well i agree but its always not true. I think you will figure something out if you speak loud enough in the microphone, you will have everybody's attention. That is why i think we should be able to have our phones not because of free time but just in case of an emergency. I hope that you agree with me!!

Sincerely,

"The advantages of limiting car usage are,street parking and driveways are now. car ownership only alloowed two places to park and that  large garages at the egde of the development where the car owner can buy space. Without that you wont be able to park anywhere  you would be better off walking or riding a bicycle.

There been efforts to make cities better for walking home and to other places. some countries developed increase of numbers of private cars owned and are being used with private parking spaces. It is a huge effect of reducing greenhouse gas if theres not lots of driving 50 percent of some car intensive area are effected. they are starting car reduced communities and legislator just for cautious to limit greenhouse gas from going out.

Many experts  expect public transportation serving to play a big role in the new limiting car usuage. They made the motorist leave there cars at home or suffer a big fine. They did care even if you have a license plate or a odd number plate. They also limited car usuage because france uses diesel fuel  and that was a big impact in western europe.

A car free day was made buses or taxes were the only cars permitted. They used those to ride to work or any other alternative to reduce smog. That was the best opportunity to clear air pollution. Many people from other countries came to see and celebrate the event that was happening. So many bicycle paths were made just because there were no more car usuage that was the most in any amercican city.

Sidewalks were replaced by even better smoother sidewalks even a rush hour started to happen now that the car usuage was limited. That dramatically cut traffic for taxes and any other vehicle that was still in usage. Some people feel more connected over the internet now instead of using there car to go see them all these changes made it  hard to continue the habit of not driving.

Since the cars were out of usage a bike shaing program started and really increased the population that has been dropped because of all the cars not in use. If you were around the age sixteen and thirty nine you could get your lisence and start to drive again.                  ";0
"Sure thing! Here's my essay:

Examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice are all powerful tools that can influence others in a positive way. Let me explain why.

First, examples are a great way to influence others. When someone sees someone else doing something, they are more likely to do it too. For instance, if a friend of mine always brings their reusable water bottle to school, I'm more likely to start doing it too. It's like, if you see someone else doing something good, it makes it seem cooler or more normal. And if it's something that's good for the environment, that's even better!

Actions can also influence others in a positive way. When someone sees someone else doing something kind or helpful, it can inspire them to do the same. Like, if a teacher volunteers at a local food bank, it might make me want to volunteer too. Or if a classmate helps someone carry their books, it might make me want to do the same for someone else.

Reasons are another way to influence others. When someone explains why something is important, it can make more sense to others. For example, if a coach tells us why exercise is good for our health, it's more likely to make us want to start exercising too. Or if a parent tells us why it's important to finish our homework, it's more likely to make us want to finish it.

Finally, personal advice can be really influential. When someone gives us advice based on their own experiences, it can be really helpful. Like, if a coach tells me how to improve my basketball skills, it's more likely to help me than if someone else just tells me to practice more. Or if a teacher gives me advice on how to study for a test, it's more likely to help me than if a friend just tells me to study harder.

Overall, examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice are all really important ways to influence others positively. By using these tools, we can inspire others to do good things and make the world a better place.

That's my essay! I hope it's not too bad. Let me know if you have any questions or need any help!";1
"To the principal,

Your new policy about sports and other extra-curricular activities is a very good plan.

However, many students will not benefit from this plan.

Most of the students have a C average, and if you put your policy into effect, they may not be able to do many after school activities.

Though your policy will encourage students to strive for good grades, it may not work.

You would be taking away opportunities for them to broaden their horizons and grow to their full potential. I am writing to advise you against this new change in the policy.

Many students enjoy the sports and clubs that they are able to participate in.

However, if you change the policy, students with a grade average below a B will not have this opportunity.

Therefore I do not agree with you changing the policy.

Students will not be able to do some of the activities provided to them.

This would not be fair to the majority of the student body.

One specific reason I do not support your new policy is because many students try their hardest, but simply just cannot maintain a B average.

If you were to take the average of all of the grades of the entire student body and average them together, you could make that the requirement instead.

That way all of the students have a goal that they can actually achieve.

Plus, they have a reward for maintaining their good grades.

Though your policy would encourage students to keep good grades, there are some students who just are not able to maintain a B average.

Many students enjoy the opportunity to expand their horizon and learn new things.

Nevertheless, if the policy is changed, that opportunity may be taken away from some of the students.

Then they would not have a chance to grow and learn new things.

Isn't that what school is supposed to be all about?

Learning new things, taking chances, and making the best of you opportunities?

If you change the school's policy on extra-curricular activities, how will they ever achieve that?

Students need to have a good academic standard, but they also need to have a chance to grow and explore new things. With a change in the school's policy, many students may not have the chance to explore the world and discover who they are.

Sports and clubs provide a good start for students to discover what they are good at, and then take it one step farther and discover what they want to do with their life.

If they do not have the opportunity to discover this, then what is the point of sending them to school?

School is supposed to provide a way for students to do something with their life, and if they do not know what they want to do with their life, then what will they do in the future.

People need a way to prepare themselves for what lies ahead, and if they don't know how to deal with it, then their lives could be changed forever.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and address my concerns.

I wish you the best of luck and know you will do what you think is best for this school and its student body.

I hope you will take what I have said into account and use this knowledge accordingly.";0
"Hello principal I do believe that school's our school should have cell phones in school when ever kids have extra time cause its important to have an time to communicate with our fellow students and that's one good and easy way. An example we can call our parents if we need some thing or text them for emergency's, or just to say I love you. Say no ones perfect and if you are a really person you do forget things and what one good way to get what you need when you leave something? Text your mom during lunch time.

People at school get hurt all the time and say the office needs to know your mom or dad's cell phone and they didn't put it on the card? We students could use our phones so nothing bad would really happen cause you mom is all ready here and got what you need. I think we should have phones at school to call for rides and call home to see if we can go with our friend or say some guy comes and say your mom wanted me to pick you up and you didn't know him? If you had your cell phone with you, you can call her up and see if this is true or not so have an cell phones could keep you safe for many reasons.

I gladly agree that some of our fellow students use their cell phones for many good and bad reasons and their not going to stop even if you stop for good they would try and try to and some of them will do and succeed, so why stop forever? Texting is our generation cell phones is what this society lives with. School's across the world would want all the kids coming to school, seeing the attence go up by a bunch";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have recently heard that you are thinking about raising the grade to a b average for athletic participation. I myself disagree with this. I would want to keep it at a c average because some students who are very good athletically don't have very good grades. How would you feel to see a star athlete sit on the bench the whole game because he never turned an assignment in or he failed a test. This in my opinion is very wrong and you should keep it as it stands at a c average.

My first reason why you should keep it to a c average is because students don't have very good grades. This goes for athletic participation, after school activities, etc. For example if they make a 75% in math class but they make b' s in Language arts, Science, and Social Studies and you sit them out for a whole to games that wouldn't be fair. I remember my sixth grade year when my mom and dad saw my report card and they said ""son, so what do you think we are going to do"". I remember not being able to go to my games, practices, friends houses, and other fun activities like that. Please don't take this away from the students who work hard at what they do in football, basketball, baseball, and other sports let em roll with a c and they can go on in life.

My last reason why they should be able to participate with a c is because we all know they work very hard in school. This includes working hard on tests, quizzes, class work, homework, etc. If I were a coach I would get onto the student and tell him to get it together if he had a c average, but I wouldn't make him sit on the bench at games or practices. If I were you I would take this into a big consideration.

To my conclusion don't take this away from a student with a c average. Let them go far in life. Let them dream. If they're stars let them shine. This is all I have to say and I hope you give it some thought, thank you.!

"Summer porjects should be designed by the students because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that.

Not all students understand a project the same, some need extra help understanding the project, everyone has a different mindset. Students would make the project at their own pace, others would make the project fun and not a long and boring one, since its summer it should all be about doing fun things, they would actually understand it since its their own, and they wouldn't hate it as much.

After a long school year students need a break from all of the studying and work they been doing in school, some students have stress from all of the projects that the teachers leave them and they would appreciate to do a project of their own and not a boring project, some others may suffer from anxiety which means a painful or fearful uneasiness of mind usually over an impending or anticipated event,other students might actually enjoy doing a project for once since its their own.

Students usually get summer jobs, since they want to make money of their own since they can't becasue they are busy with school. While doing their project they would bring stuff from their work depending where they work at, and since its theirs they wouldn't have to work hard and maily focuse in makijng the money they need, they may be working to save up money for college since its extremely expensive or help their parents pay the bills its good to start paying bills at a young age.

This is why students should make their summer projects and not the teachers because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that and to be honest majority of the students aren't going to do the project regardless if they make it or if the teachers make it since its summer.";0
"In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about how the author describes new technology called the Facial Action Coding System which identifys the human emotions. This technology shouldn't read the students' facial expression. It shouln't read a students facial expressions because first off there's no reason to do it at a school especially. Second of all there's more other emotions than happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness to tell of your face or mood. And the last reason is there's other new technology that can copy the 3-D face plus it could be dangerous.

First off, there's no reason to do it in a school. Mainly because at a school you learn about different subjects like math, english, science, etc. I do not think this is some ""lab experiment"" either. Although the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, and has all the 44 major muscles in the model to move like the human muscles. Do we really need all that just to tell what your facial expression is saying.

Second of all there's other emotions than happiness,surprised, anger, fear, and sadness. Also there is lots of names on your face of what shows the emotion you are in. Orbicularis oris tightens your lip which shows anger, the zygomatic major lifts up the corner of your mouths,oculi pars palpabraeus make the crow feet, the zygomatic major is having your mouth stretched sideways while the risorius is a different muscle. According to the article you have to make those ""fake smile"" that has all those to test your facial expression.

The last reason is because there's new studies that basically copies your facial expression or movents to a thing on the IPhone X called the Animoji. Animoji is basically an emoji coming to life and it can talk, copy your facial expression , and if you move your head around it'll move it's head around. Plus it's also a 3-D model as well. If the Animoji see's that your eyebrows are up or down, the corner of your mouth is lifted, or that your eyes are squinted it will copy every movement. Its dangerous beacuse apparently once it captures your face, basically the government or polices will know where to find you or how you look like all because of that.

Those are my reasons why this technology should not be used on students is because first off there is no reason to do it at a school, second of all there's other facial expressions other than happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and my last reason is because there's new studies and it could be dangerous fo student.

"First, i think it's a good idea because, it's more comfortable for us (students) and we have our personal teacher; the students can learn more easily, in my opinion i prefer more take classes in my house with my personal teacher, although the technology every day make our life more easily, but not every-body prefer this idea, some students like assist to the school because their have your friends there, others don't like the idea to learn in their houses, one reason that i prefer learn in my house is i dont need wake up at 5AM, i have enough friends and i don't need to walk or take the bus to going to the school, but not every-body are equal.

Causes of consequence of these are:

* You probably are aisle.

* You don't like the school.

* Your parents thinks about the conferring or video classes.

*You feel more comfortable your house.

* You don't like how the teachers explain.

All of this causes of consequence show us the reality about why students prefer more video conferring than school, with your personal teacher you can ask over, and over again no matter what; he/she know that you are the only student so, in the school you can ask about over ad over again but it's not the same, there are more students and you teacher just have approximately 1 hour with 30 minute just for one subject, i think it's not enough time to learn. In the school there are many distractions like friends, boyfriend/girlfriend and others smallest details.

Why I'm going to the school? I'm going to the school for those reasons:

*Baseball programs

*I don't know how the online or conferencing working.

* My parents do not have enough money to pay it.

*I can't speak the language.

*In the school i have all my friends.

to sum up, the school bring to us every things that we need, like pen, scissors, piece of paper and others things. So if you prefer the school more than video-conferring you need take the bus, wake up at 5AM or 6AM, take a shower in the morning, the most probably you are tired at the end of the day. My brother did the college in a web site, i always ask, questions like that: How do you feel taking class in your house? are you always understand? Is it easy or hard? the last time that i saw him he told me yes i like the program, it's not difficult, i have more time to work, in my opinion is easy, but not every-body think equal that others.

In Conclusion, the school teach you about the values, things that you really need in the future, the video conferencing program just teach you the assigments and you need to pay it, the school are free and you can participate in sport programs like baseball, football, tennis whatever you want, the confering programs you can understand more easily and ask what-ever you want the thing is learn, in the school you can makes friends and share culture, Example: i am dominicane, i share my culture with my salvadorians friends. the conferencing programs doesn't have time to take it, in the school you need to stay there at 6:40 AM, the school bring you all of you need. finally i think is most better assits to the school.                                                                                                             ";0
"In this modern age, approximately three percent of all students in the United States are fixated in their home or in a hospital due to an illness or a disability. These students do not have the ability to attend a classroom, in which they can absorb the knowledge that they need in order to advance forward in life. However, they have nothing else but to stare blankly through the window of their room or to mindlessly wait as they recover. On a different note, many students such as myself can not always attend school each and every day, whether it is due to a sickness or a disability that affects the student physically or mentally. In regards to the implement of a distance learning option in the current education system, students all across the United States and beyond would be benefited by a decrease in information that is forgotten as well as a stronger connection between the student and teacher.

Many students have realized that if they were to miss even a single day of school, no matter the reason, they are likely to have a hard time gathering and understanding the information that they had missed. Now imagine that you were not physically able to come to school for a significant amount of time, how would you find a way to make up the immense amount of knowledge that you missed? This is a situation that I was personally involved in, in which I had previously contracted a combination of the flu as well as the horrible symptoms of calcium deficiency. While I was under the effects of the illnesses, I was physically not able to attend school for five consecutive days as well as finish the assignments that I had missed. As soon as I fully recovered and was able to attend school, my class had already finished the previous section that I had missed and had moved into learning brand new information. While I tried to make up my missed work and assignments, I was under immense pressure of keeping up with my past assignments as well as my current assignments at the time. As you can see, missing any time from school and trying to make up your past work as well as completing your current work can be very strenuous for any student. With the help of a online software that can display the information discussed in a class, many students would be able to regain the knowledge that they had missed and be better adapted towards getting back into class.

Something that is usually not discussed in the education system is the relationship that is built between the student and the teacher. This connection can more or less affect the way how the student learns and gathers information as well as how the teacher teaches and communicates the information to their students. As I have seen throughout my time in various schools, the teachers that have displayed the class's information in an inviting and fun manner are the classes that I tend to do the best in. On the contrary, I have also seen that if the teachers were to showcase the class's information in a mildly harsh or rude manner, I usually end up getting an average score in the class. On the other hand of this topic, some individuals may suggest that the connection between the student and teacher has no meaningful impact on how well the student gains the information. Although this aspect of education may not be as important as people may say, there is definitely a correlation between how strong the connection between the student and the teacher to how well the student receives and understands the information that they are given. If students and teachers were given a software that would allow the student to contact their teacher regarding their assignments, it is with great certainty that the student would be more able to thoroughly understand the information that they had missed as well as develop a meaningful connection with their teacher.

To conclude, the use of a online software that would allow students and teachers alike to vitually communicate regarding school assignments and such would be incredibly beneficial towards the student's education as well as the teacher's general understanding of their class. This software would also be especially beneficial to a student who was unable to attend school, whether it was due to an illness or disability, by allowing them to learn the information that they had missed. Various benefits such as a decrease in knowledge that is forgotten and a stronger connection built between the student and teacher can all be provided by the implement of an online communication system. With the help of an online communication software, countless students in the United States would be incredibly benefited as well as encouraged to do well in school. ";0
"Dear principal, there has been arguments about everyone in the school performing community service. I think that everyone should have a choice if they want to do community service. I think that community service should be for extra credit because other people don't want to do community service.

In my opinion i think that community service is needed because it really helps are community in many ways such as cleaning up the trash. It is important because it helps clean our environment. Also that the community doesn't need to hire workers to do it, so the community gets to say money. Another example is tutoring elementary children. This helps because some kids are in need of helps, and as I said teachers and parents don't need to pay for the tutor.

I think people who don't want to do community service think it's too much work. I don't think its a lot of work because you get to help out the community. Also I think that when people say community service, people think that its only just picking up trash, and they think its dirty, but community service isn't just picking up trash its about tutoring other children, and helping at the park.

In conclusion I think that everyone should do community service and help out the com";0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have seen firsthand the pros and cons of allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time. While some argue that students should be allowed to have phones during lunchtime and other free time as long as they turn them off while learning, others argue that this policy is harmful to students' education and social skills. In this essay, I will analyze the arguments for and against this idea and argue that the principal should not allow students to bring cell phones to school.

On one hand, proponents of allowing students to bring cell phones to school argue that it can improve communication between students and parents, increase safety, and provide students with access to educational resources. For example, if a student forgets their lunch or needs to communicate with their parents during the day, having a cell phone can be helpful. Additionally, some argue that cell phones can be used as educational tools, such as for research or learning new skills.

On the other hand, opponents of allowing students to bring cell phones to school argue that it can be distracting to students during class, disrupt classroom dynamics, and decrease students' social skills. For example, if students are constantly checking their phones during class, they may not be fully engaged in the lesson and may miss important information. Additionally, some argue that cell phones can create a divide between students who have them and those who do not, leading to social isolation for some students.

In my opinion, the benefits of allowing students to bring cell phones to school do not outweigh the potential drawbacks. While communication between students and parents can be improved, this benefit is outweighed by the potential for distraction and social isolation. Additionally, while cell phones can be used as educational tools, they can also be used for non-educational purposes, such as social media and gaming, which can be detrimental to students' academic performance.

Furthermore, allowing students to bring cell phones to school can set a dangerous precedent. If students are allowed to bring cell phones to school, it may be difficult to enforce rules about other electronic devices, such as tablets or laptops. This could lead to a situation where students are constantly using electronic devices during class, making it difficult for teachers to maintain order and focus on teaching.

In conclusion, while the idea of allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch";1
"The Face of Mars isn't a face at all! It's just the shadows that gives the eyes, nose and mouth a look. It could be possible for the aliens to create the Face of Mars but it'll take ages for the aliens to perform a task like that. The Face of Mars is only a Natural Landform that has been around Mars since it was created.

The Face of Mars is located in Cydonia in Mars. Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there.

It really wasn't build by aliens nor any other creature out in space. The Face of Mars was made 25yrs ago. No one knows how it was made but it was located in Cydonia on Mars.

The Face, however, is an illusion using the shadows as the eyes, mouth, and the nose. One day in Sept. 1997, MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, had landed onto the Red Planet had confirmed it as a natural landform. Not everyone was satisfied since they wanted more proof for this. It was April '98, cloudy time of year on Mars, where people couldn't use their telescopes to see the Face for themselves. So, on April 8th, 2001, MGS gotten close enough for another look. They've took another picture using a better camera that could see anything clear like a airplane, a truck, or a Egyptian-style pyramids! Once they've gotten the picture, People were satisfied.

Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.";0
"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that music, art, and drama classes should not be required for high school students. While these subjects are undoubtedly important for personal development and self-expression, they are not essential for academic success or future career prospects.

Firstly, music, art, and drama classes require a significant amount of time and resources that could be better spent on core subjects such as math, science, and language arts. These subjects are crucial for students to develop a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential for success in college and beyond. In addition, many high school students already have a strong interest in these subjects and may choose to pursue them outside of school, such as through extracurricular activities or private lessons.

Secondly, many high school students may not have a natural talent or interest in music, art, or drama. Forcing these students to take these classes may result in a negative experience and discourage them from pursuing their passions. Instead, students should be given the opportunity to choose their own classes based on their interests and strengths.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that music, art, and drama classes are directly related to academic success or future career prospects. While these subjects may be valuable for personal development and self-expression, they do not necessarily translate into practical skills or knowledge that are in demand in the workforce.

In conclusion, while music, art, and drama classes may be important for personal development and self-expression, they are not essential for academic success or future career prospects. High school students should be given the opportunity to choose their own classes based on their interests and strengths, and resources should be allocated towards core subjects such as math, science, and language arts.";1
"Hello there my name is Generic_Name and I was wondering if you think students would actually attend the class from home rather than a public or private school? Well i'm going to tell you how I feel about it because I can imagine half of the students not taking it as serious as others would. Most students would actually attend the classes and taking it serious so they can get their education on time. Half of the students wouldn't take it serious because they are at home and feel like they can just do anything because there's no teacher in their face. More students would do it because they feel more comfortable and safe at home doing work than in school. The students are going to take it as a joke and lack because they aren't with their friends.

Most students would actually attend the classes and take it serious so they can get their education on time. The students who actually take it serious are going to graduate on time and also be something they always wanted to be in life. A lot of parents would make their child do the work so they won't be a failure in life. The ones who take it serious wouldn't be behind on the work because they are actually attending the class on time. I would allow kids to do the work at home because they can focus more and really do the work and turn it in on time. The parents shouldn't allow them to have no tech time until their work is actually done and turned in.

Half of the students wouldn't take it serious because they are at home and feel like they can just do anything because there's no teacher in their face. A lot of students would fail because they feel like they can just do anything they want to do. Most of the students would not do any work. A lot of students would just be lazy and sit in the bed and do no work and not graduate on time with their friends. I feel like the classes at home should be mandatory so all students can graduate on time instead of being a failure in life.

More students would do it because they feel more comfortable and safe at home doing work than in school. The students sometimes don't feel safe around other's because of how they act. More students feel more comfortable and safe at home because they know their environment more. All students don't feel the same at school because some feel more violated than other's. Everybody can work in different environments than other's. More young people like to work in quiet and alone places because they can focus on the work and also feel safe.

Most students would actually attend the classes and take it serious so they can get their education on time. Half of the students wouldn't take it serious because they are at home and feel like they can just do anything because there's no teacher in their face. More students would do it because they feel more comfortable and safe at home doing work than in school. I'll rather work at home because I feel like i can focus more better and actually do the work. Certain kids would rather do it at school than home because the teacher can explain the work more better in person.";0
"The Electoral College should stay because it lets other people choose the president on behalf of the people. The Electoral College helps so that there is not a big problem with people going and having to do all that work themselves. Some people dont like having to vote the way the Electoral College does so they just take the majority vote and puts that in for us so we dont have to do it. It lets us choose and go home so that were not goin out all day waiting for so many people to do the majority now its all online which makes it even easier to tally it all up and see who gets the vote.

The Electoral College is just making everything alought easier for us and we are able to spend less time in a voting area waiting for people to get done. The online voting helps out alought because we are able to get everything done a whole lot easier then others. There is also a smaller line with the online thing so that most people dont have to wait as long. Unless you get that one person who is taking forever and doesnt want to leave the booth then you are there all day and nobody wants that to happen because that would not leave you having a good day for nobody.

But the majority vote could be good to only having to split up the vote and the president is whoever got the most votes. But the only outcome of that is someone not liking the president or the president isnt doing very well in anything and he just sits there not doing anything. Then that president would have to be impeached and we will have to get a new president and nobody wants to go through that. Some people might want to go through that and get a new president only because they dont like him or hes not doing to well in anything or he is just a stoubern president and doesnt like makeing rash decisions. But that president is going to have to get over that.    ";0
"Students should be given the opportunity to design their own summer projects because they would all learn from eachother while practicing teamwork, and this would allow them to choose a topic within their interest which would improve their performances and increase their effort towards the project.

For example, Once in my science class we were all given the opportunity to choose our own summer project topic as a class while doing our own research and designing our presentations. During the creating process, everyone reached out to eachother and used their personal skills and strengths to help one another and come together as a team. When it got to the time where we had to present at the, everyone's hard work and research, along with personal skill, we were able to do a great job by taking leadership and teaching each other new things without a teacher involved.

This shows that students can take leadership while working together without a teacher's ideas in the center of the project.

Students designing their own projects gives them the chance to choose a specific topic within their interests which would improve their performance and increase the amount of effort that they give towards the project.

For instance, while given the chance to choose my own topic during an individual project , I was able to focus more and put in more effort due to my motivation because I was able to do my project on the topic that I liked.

This proves that when students are given the chance to do something that they like and that interests them , their performance and effort may improve because it is the topic of their choice.

Some people say that teachers should design summer projects because they are more trustworthy and that students may just choose a topic that is easy and quick so that they can finish early.

However, they are wrong because teachers may choose a topic that students are not interested in and that the students may not understand, leaving more work to the teachers because they students may need extra assistance and may lack motivation.

For example, If a class is given a project on something they never learned in detail or showed interest in during class time and they have to research it over the summer, the class will not be motivated to put in much effort and will rely on the teacher for information, this will put more work on the teacher.

Giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects more frequently should be considered, to improve their motivation and effort and to help them learn teamwork from each other.          ";0
"In the vast and diverse world we live in today, there are countless cultures and traditions that shape the way people learn and grow. Among these cultures, China stands out as one of the most unique and fascinating. Chinese people have developed a rich and complex understanding of the world, one that differs significantly from the philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson. In this essay, I will explore the ways in which Chinese people learn and grow, and examine how these practices differ from Emerson's ideas.

First and foremost, it is important to understand that Chinese culture places a strong emphasis on education and personal growth. From a young age, Chinese children are encouraged to learn and excel in a variety of subjects, including language, math, science, and the arts. This emphasis on education is reflected in the fact that many Chinese students attend school for up to 12 hours a day, and that the pressure to succeed academically is immense.

In addition to formal education, Chinese people also place a high value on informal learning and personal development. This is reflected in the many traditional practices and customs that are still widely followed in China today. For example, many Chinese people practice tai chi and qigong, which are ancient Chinese exercises that promote physical and mental health. These practices are not just about physical fitness, but also about cultivating inner peace and balance.

Another important aspect of Chinese culture is the emphasis on family and community. Chinese people are taught from a young age to value their relationships with their family and community members, and to prioritize the needs of others. This is reflected in the many customs and traditions that are centered around family and community, such as the importance of ancestor worship and the celebration of Lunar New Year.

While Chinese culture places a strong emphasis on education and personal growth, it differs significantly from the philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson in several key ways. Emerson, a prominent American philosopher and essayist, believed in the importance of individualism and self-reliance. He emphasized the importance of developing one's own unique identity and pursuing one's own goals and aspirations, rather than conforming to societal expectations.

In contrast, Chinese culture places a strong emphasis on the importance of community and social harmony. While individualism is valued, it is not prioritized above the needs of the community as a whole. Chinese people are taught to";1
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring venus,""the author suggests that studing venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present""because venus was probably covered largely with oceans and cloud have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

The National Aeronautics and space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms , a velicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.

Therefore striving to meet the challlenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.";0
"Many students have expressed that projects should not be given over summer break. Students feel they should not have to do work during their summer break, Just as much as teachers shouldnt not have to grade papers over their summer break, If summer projects must be assigned they should be student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because the students would know how to complete the assignment, they would also find more interest, and more then likely the project would be completed with effort.

Over the summer most students are sent home with no instruction or contact availability. Students would attempt to do the assignment with no teacher guidance or help from others. With out the proper help the project could be completed wrong and completed with out any effort. When attempting to do my own summer project I stumbled into a problem and had no way to correct the problem, If summer projects were student made there are no excuses for not understanding how to complete the work.

Every student has a least favorite class, many would complain about a summer project from a boring or hard class. More students are likely to complete something that is more appealing to them personally. For example art is a more appealing subject to one, while someone else could be interested in history. Making your own project could be more intriguing which will make someone want to actually do the assignment they have created.

Majority of high school student do not complete their summer project. When a student completes the work it is more for the grade then personal gain. With the option to have students create their own projects brings creativity, interest, and effort. Many individuals put more effort into their own creations like art, putting more effort will cause more learning for the students personal gain, and the projects would be done nicely.

Many schools require summer projects to be completed. These projects would be more beneficial if students were able to create their own assignment. The idea of student designed projects are more beneficial because students would know how to complete the work, they would find more interest, and the project would be completed with more effort put into it. ";0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Being true to yourself is super important, even when everyone around you is trying to tell you otherwise. Like, my family is always on my case about picking a ""cool"" hobby or liking the ""right"" music, but I'm like, ""Uh, no thanks."" I mean, I could totally care less about playing basketball or listening to pop music if that's what everyone else is into, but it's not really me. And honestly, it's kinda suffocating trying to fit in with everyone else's expectations all the time.

I know some people might be like, ""But what about when your family is trying to help you? They just want what's best for you!"" And yeah, I get that. But sometimes what's best for me is just being able to chill out and do my own thing without feeling like I'm gonna get judged or anything. Like, I could totally see why someone would want to play an instrument or join a sports team, but it's just not my thing. And that's okay!

I think a lot of people struggle with this stuff, especially in middle school. It's like, everyone's trying to figure out who they are and where they fit in, and it can be really hard to do that when everyone around you is trying to tell you what's cool or what you should like. But honestly, the only person who really knows what's best for you is yourself. So yeah, it might be hard to stand up to your family or your friends when they're trying to pressure you into doing something you don't really want to do, but it's important to be true to yourself.

Like, I know some people who totally changed their interests and hobbies just to fit in with their friends, and it's like, dude, where's the fun in that?! You're gonna be way happier and more fulfilled if you do things that make you happy, even if they're not what everyone else is doing. And hey, maybe you'll even inspire some of your friends to be more themselves too!

So yeah, being true to yourself might be hard";1
"PHONES AND DRIVING

Although cell phones have been in this world for a while they have made their way into our daily lives, we use them for just about everything like texting, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can multitask while being on it. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong times to multi task: while they're driving. As a nation, we have become so focused on how much we can do do at one time that we are literally putting our life on the line, all because we can't put down our cell phones. Using any handheld device while driving is dangerous to the drivers for a couple of good reasons.

When driving sometimes it's difficult to focus on the road and where your trying to go, which makes it easy to forget the road is shared by people doing the same thing. It's not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice to drivers on their phone whether its intentional or because of the hazard caused by it. When driving there is a great deal of skill and expertise that should go int maneuvering a 2-ton vehicle around and with other 2-ton vehicles so why end to life with a 1-pound phone?

Recently there has been a law passed saying you can't have your phone in your hand while driving and if you do and get caught you have to pay a pretty big fine. Its literally seen as illegal and there are still major accidents because of it. Using your phone while driving, no matter how good you are at driving is dangerous to the person driving, the possible passengers and the rest of the community having to deal with the reckless endangerment of citizens who don't put law and safety over their own entertainment and connection to other people. it's wrong and its being stopped slowly but surely         ";0
"Can Driverless Cars Truly Be Driverless?

Driverless cars throw people off because how could a car be driverless when the driver still has to be paying attention to the road? The driver has to be prepared at all times to be ready to take over the wheel. Drivers can not fully rely on driverless cars because drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, drivers are trusting a computer with their life, and the dangers of bordem behind the wheel.

Drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, even if the ""driverless"" car is driving. The driverless car can not drive through work zones or around accidents, so the driver has to take control. The driver has to stay alert and ready for anything to come their way. The Google car announces when the driver should be ready to take control, but shouldn't a driverless car be able to drive on it's own? Eventhough the car can drive itself, the driver is still in position like they're going to drive too.

Drivers are trusting a computer based opperator with their life. What if the car was to get in an accident? Whose fault would it be? Drivers can't fully trust a computer to drive their car because they computer could mess up, and could cause an accident. What if a kid were riding a bike, and were to suddenly fall into the street and the driverless car did not read it? That would cause a big uproar for driverless cars. They are not proven to be 100% safe for the world around us.

The dangers of bordem of not driving could be very serious as well. The driver has to pay attention to the road at all times, but they are not driving. This could cause serious bordem, and could lead to falling asleep behind the wheel. At least when driving is occoured the driver has something to do.

Now a driverless car is not a bad idea. The text says that driverless cars use half the fuel that cars use today, and that driverless cars have driven half a million miles without a crash. Driverless cars could be the future, but there would still need to be a lot of work done to the cars to make sure they are completely safe for drivers. Instally cameras in the car would also help with teenagers, and some adults to not be behind the wheel on their phone, which could lead to less accidents. So, driverless cars are a good thing that could come into society.

Driverless cars sound dangerous right now, but as technology advances, they could help in the future. As of right now, driverless cars not be fully relied on because drivers still have to pay attention to the road, computers can crash, and the dangers of falling asleep behind the wheel could be dangerous. Driverless cars are not ready to be on the roads yet.";0
"Dear Mr. Senator,

Around my community, there has been a lot of talk about how the president should be elected into office. Whether it is from the electorial college or by popular vote. This is a very important matter to me because it can change how our country is. In my opinion, it should be by the electorial college. I'm not saying the elctorial college is the right way but I would really like if you can look into it.

My question to you Mr. senator is why you wouldnt want to take the process of the electorial college to pick a president? All of the pieces seem to fall into place. So isnt it the obvious choice? See, the person who gets the most ammount of votes gets to be the president. Thats as simple as it can get. And in my opinion, it is as fair as it gets. It is also not a democratic method of selecting the next person in office.

So Mr. Senator, all i want you to do is look into the elctoral college. It is obviously the right choice. So please, make the whole community happier and use the better way. Be fair to our country and make us happy to live in the best country in then world. The United States of America.    ";0
"Should Drivers be Allowed to Use Cell Phones While Driving?

According to the LA Times, 253 million vehicles are on the roads in the US. Since there are so many cars on the road, safety is a pressing issue for the American public. At first it was concern over seatbelts, then drinking and driving, and now it is cell phone usage while driving. Since the rise of cell phones, more cases of drivers crashing due to being distracted by their phones. Due to this, it should not be allowed for individuals to use their phones because they have increased the risk of crashes, fatalites, and injuries.

It was reported by Edgarsnyder. com, that according to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million crashes are caused by cell phones every year. This displays the danger that cell phones pose to the everyday driver. And the danger only becomes more clear when one compares the cell phone crashes to the total number of crashes per year. According to USA Today, out of all the crashes that happen in the United States everyday, 1 out of 4 are caused by cell phones.

These statistics are exactly what shows how dangerous cell phones can be. Distracted driving is one of the main sources of crashes and they are a danger to the modern driver.

Edgarsynder. com reports that every year, 390,000 people are injured in cell phone related incidents on the road. Distracted driving has now become more dangerous than drunk driving. In a report posted by TheZebra. com, 101,000 more people are injured by distracted driving than drunk driving. This clearly demonstrates the inherent danger cell phones displaywhen drivers use them. And since this past time is so dangerous, insurance for those have been caught texting and driving are paying the price. In a report posted by TheZebra. com, in 2011 the penalty for texting and driving was $2.35 added to the premium price. In 2017, the fine added was $226.36. That is an increase of 7,944% in the penalty price. So not only is distracted driving dangerous for the drivers' life, it is also dangerous for the drivers' wallet as well.

In a article posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 3,166 people a year are killed because they were texting and driving. That is almost half the number people killed due to drunk driving, which also according to the NHTSA, is 7,000 people a year. Edgarsnyder. com reported that 21% of all fatal teen crashes are caused by distracted driving. The action of using cell phones while driving is not only an unnecessary risk to the American public's safety, it does not seem to have an impact on how dangerous it is to the teens of America. Also mentioned by Edgarsnyder. com, AAA conducted a survey in which 94% of teens said they knew that texting and driving is dangerous, but 35% of those teens said they did it regardless of how dangerous it was. This shows just how little the youth of America know about the dangers of distracted driving.

The NHTSA says that at any given time, 660,000 people are using their cell phones while they drive. This means that 660,000 Americans are gambling with their lives. Distracted driving is a epidemic in America, and it should not be allowed under any circumstances. It is a deadly and costly endeavour that does not have any benefit to those who choose to participate in this affair. Texting and driving is illegal for a reason, because it has been proven that it should not be done.

"During this time in the world most people own a cellular device.

People use and take their phones everywhere including while they are driving on the road. While many people could also need the device for important things. This small device can generate lots of disasters. A phone while driving should be taken seriously and mostly while driving.

Life is precious and in just minutes it can all be gone. In this case having a phone in your hand while driving is like having your life and other people's life in your hands. In just seconds from you looking away from the road everything can be gone and everything happens in just an instant. While driving people can get distracted by their phone while looking at a video or a message that just got sent. While it can be tinting to grab the phone and grab that call or look at that message you should really just let it wait. And if you think that it's important you can make a stop at a gas station or a public place and take the call or read the message.

Being on the road is a privilege that should be used wisely. The reasons are that you are more likely to be in a car crash. This can be not only physically but mentally harmful to you and the other person involved. For example talking in the physical term you can have a brain injury, be in coma, have to have a body part cut off , or even die. Mentally you can have mental anguish, emotional distress, and sleep disturbance which are just some of the things that can happen after being involved in a crash.

Even though this experience can be a disturbing thing in someone's life. There are also some reasons why a person should use their phone while driving. For example, if you really need to take a call at that moment, need to use gps, or if it's for a health emergency. Though these are some reasons there is no excuse for a person to put themselves and other people in danger. There are other solutions to not use a phone while driving. That can save your life and someone else's

In conclusion, it's not a great idea to drive and use your phone at the same time. Even though nothing happens to you while using, no one knows what's gonna happen the next day. That way it's better to prevent and stay safe. And not only think of yourself but others.   ";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To me community service is important and all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should be required to participate in community service. Community service is very important. I believe responsibility for serving these hours should begin in sixth grade with a requirement of about ten hours. Then the hours per student should increase as the grade the student is in increases. If students are required to achieve service hours it will do a lot of good for them and for their community.

A positive consequence for the students at SCHOOL_NAME would be preparing them for high school. At most Catholic high schools community service is definitely a big part of a student's education. At SCHOOL_NAME or SCHOOL_NAME, service hours are required in a large quantity. This is one reason why I think community service would help the students of SCHOOL_NAME

Another reason is to teach kids at young a age the great part about helping people. Sure you could just tell them it is good to help somebody but telling them won't put them in a habit of helping. If the students go out and help others on a pretty regular basis then it will become a habit of helping others and they will do something to help more people in their community without having to think twice about it.

Community service would also be a great advantage for SCHOOL_NAME and attract more people to this school. People who see students from SCHOOL_NAME helping in their community will want to send their child here. Most parents would like to send their child to a school with community service to teach him or her morals and discipline. It would be excellent for SCHOOL_NAME to adopt this idea of community service.

In conclusion, I believe community service would do tons of good for the students, SCHOOL_NAME and the whole community. Not only would this go to the student's advantage and would give everyone, including SCHOOL_NAME, an edge. TEACHER_NAME, if you propose and adopt this idea, I guarantee you will not regret it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME";0
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is an article about trying to explore Venus and the obstacles that need to be overcome. It starts first by telling the reader some information about Venus, such as that Venus is similar to Earth in density and size (paragraph 2). Then goes on to say a few challenges like the earthquakes and temperature. However, I don't think the author supports the idea of studying Venus though it is dangerous.

First, the author doesn't give any information on what we could get out of studying Venus. In paragraph 4 in the last sentence the article speaks as if it will later talk of the productiveness of the mission, however the author says in paragraph 8,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors."" The quote doesn't say any physical reward that could help anybody. Knowledge is pointless if it cannot be used, which the knowledge from or of Venus is pointless becuase it can't be used.

The author also speaks of the challenges but doesn't solve them well. Firstly, the challenges they spoke of include a mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere, sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, an 800 degree surface, atmospheric pressure is 90 times stronger than Earth's (The author says it's enough to crush a submarine.), liquefy many metals, erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

The first solution the author speaks of is from NASA and is a blimp-like vehicle as he put it, and would be about 30 miles above the surface to escape the ground conditions. The issue is it's still pretty hot at 170 degrees Fahrenheit and still doesn't have access to new information due to light not being able to go through the atmosphere. The next solution was eletronics made from silicon carbide that have done well in similutions of Venus's surface, however it has only been done with simple electronics, which they probably need bulkier electronics to be useful to gather information and send it from Venus's surface. Then the last idea of a solution was a mechanical computer, which is a machine doing the calculations through gears and levers (paragraph 7). The proble with using the machine is since there is no electronics, how will they recieve information from it?

Due to the lack of quality of solutions and the little explanation of reward for studying Venus the author doesn't support the idea that studying Venus is worth it though the dangers. The only reward being the gaining of knowledge is pointless if we can't apply that knowledge, and conditions on Earth are definetly not as bad as Venus. Lastly, the solutions don't work well enough to be useful. Such as the blimp, it's useless to get close and not gather any information from the planet. Therefore, the author has little support that is beneficial in supporting the pursuit of studying Venus.";0
"Driverless cars have been imagined for many years. They've come close to building it but fails to be officaly called driverless cars, google has tryed but have only made it to where the car alerts a driver if to close to an object. Theirs been other ways on trying to make a driveless car but come out in fails or to expasive, like the smart-road that has been tested and has had positve records ""but that would mean we would have to change all the roads and make knew ones that would take for ever and the money we would spend on that would leave our economy more in dete then we are"". As the article said.

If driverless cars were to be created in the future how would that impact lifes and country? Well let me tell you more safte laws would have to be made ""like how would be acounted for if some one gets hurt because of a failer in the system, would it be the owner of the car or the companys fault for the failer in their technology"". As the articl said that could cause major problams. With what I just mentioned that brings me to my second question. What if something in the car fails would that impact the intier car and cuase it to break down? As the artical mentions the people trying to creat the driveless car have been testing int with a lot of different technology as said in the artical they've been using sensors, cameras and GPS on the cars, but what if one of the cameras or the sensors would fail to do their job while it's driving on a highway or a main road that would cuase a worse accident then with someone driving it.

In conclusion I would prefer driving so I have more liabilty to know where im going and know that im the one driving. So i ask you would you rather lay your life and family or friends on a a computer or know that you can drive. That is my opion on driveless cars.";0
"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Prof, Thomas Huang and Beckman institute, have made an invention""FACS"", that is able to tell someones expressions using technology. The author states the emotions of Mona Lisa's portriat by using the new technology. Do you ever think is the new invention even worth the pay or even necessary? Many people can be against it and many for it. Myself personally I am for Facial Action Coding System.

The article states, you can tell someones emotions by just looking at them. It also states that we have trouble really describing the facial trait. By using FACS, we can get the actual facial traits in someones face.

According to the author, ""'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly)."" When using the Facial Action Coding System it recognizes the facial movements in a humans actual face even in paintings. Using the ""While Looking in the Mirror"" activity we followed the steps,but what if we were to add something that nobody knew except you. The person looking at you would think you are following the script. When you use that same exact script with the other facial you added, the technology would recognize it in an instant. The author also stated moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

In conclusion we all have our opinion, if using the FACS is good or not. The Facial Action Coding System is a technology Prof. Thomas Huang And Beckman institue invented to help people figure out what a painting is offering us in emotions or even what people themsleves are offering. Either wanting to use technology or our own brains, the only person who really knows is the person who painted the painting and the person giving the facial expression.";0
"I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it's a fun and exciting program.

The text states,""The cattle-boat trips were and unbelievable opportunity for a benefiy of seeing Europe and China.""

The text also states,""But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says.

So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Another reason to join the program is you get to learn a lot of interesting stuff.

The text states,""Luke served as a night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The text also states,""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

One final reason to join the program is because if you like dangerous stuff the program is dangerous.

The text states,""Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of craked ribs.""

Those reasons are why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.  ";0
"Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it has brought about significant changes in the way we live and interact with the world. While technology has its advantages, such as increased efficiency and convenience, it has also had negative effects on our lives. One of the most significant negative effects of technology is the impact it has on our social skills.

With the rise of social media and instant messaging, people are increasingly relying on digital communication rather than face-to-face interactions. This has led to a decline in the quality of our social interactions, as we are no longer able to read nonverbal cues such as body language and tone of voice. As a result, people are becoming more isolated and disconnected from others, leading to a lack of empathy and understanding.

Another negative effect of technology is the distraction it causes from everyday tasks. For example, cell phones have become a significant distraction while driving, leading to accidents and injuries. In schools, students are using their cell phones to cheat on exams and assignments, leading to a decline in academic integrity. These distractions can lead to a lack of focus and concentration, making it difficult for people to complete tasks efficiently and effectively.

Finally, technology has become addictive, with people spending hours scrolling through social media and playing games rather than engaging in meaningful activities. This addiction can lead to a decline in productivity, as well as a lack of fulfillment and happiness in life. For example, people who spend too much time on their cell phones may neglect their relationships and personal development, leading to a lack of personal growth and fulfillment.

In conclusion, while technology has brought about significant benefits, it has also had negative effects on our lives. The decline in social skills, distraction from everyday tasks, and addiction to technology are just a few examples of the negative impact that technology can have on our lives. It is important for individuals to be aware of these effects and take steps to mitigate them, such as limiting screen time and engaging in face-to-face interactions. By doing so, we can ensure that technology continues to be a positive force in our lives.";1
"Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.

To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.

Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.

Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.

That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.

In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone. I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.   ";0
"Is the Facial Action Coding System really worth it to put it in schools and other places. This new idea can tell how you're feeling by just the scan of your face. There is alway error in such things known as technology. The idea of a scanning machine can tell how I feel seems a little different.

I don't believe this type of machines should be in our schools. I feel like this could cause confusion anf distrut form kids who don't like it. Sometimes kids like to keep to themselves and don't want some tecaher walking around taking pictures. How do we know if this is truly right. lets say that some kids get areading that they're happy or super sad when really they don't feel like that at all. There's to much error to have happen that it just doesn't seem worth it. If this has actually never been trieed on a living human who says it works. How do we know that Mona Lisa really felt like that. She can't tell us that she's dead.

With schools we need to worry on more important stuff. at times we seem to wonder why we lose out on so much money this just doesn't seem like a good investemnt. There is to much that can go wrong and not enough that can go right. Maybe later on if this was perfected but for now I don't support this. Maybe one day this will work out I just don't see it anytime soon becoming the next big thing.                                         ";0
"Venus is an extremely inhabitable environment for people. Although Venus is alike Earth in many ways, it has plenty of risk factors as well. In this text, the author makes it clear that there are bountiful amounts of information on Venus that humans could collect, but it is far too dangerous. He shows that we could find so much worthy evidence and history on this planet but it is simply too extreme. He makes note that even though it can reach 800 degrees, astronauts should still pursue the idea.

In the text the author states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This shows that getting into Venus could potentially help NASA dig deeper into other planets. A whole world of information is neighboring our planet every day.

The author also states ""imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This shows we could still escape the harsh climate to get needed information.

Venus is an incredible planet, and with time humans will be able to explore it. This text shows strong proof that traveling there is worthy. With the technology we have today, the day NASA decides to go to Venus is just around the corner. ";0
"As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons. When you consult multiple people, however, the room for error decreases significantly.

For example, if you needed to write an unbiased paper on the pros and cons of making abortion legal, asking more than one person would limit the scope of the bias. If you only asked one individual, their statements could be tainted if they had a preexisting opinion on the topic. However, if you were to consult multiple people, the scope of the bias would be severely limited. The more people, the less bias you risk, so asking only one individual could end up ruining a supposedly unbiased report. Not only is bias a problem to consider when asking individuals, making sure their statements are accurate can be equally if not more important.

When asking people for advice, you must always consider whether what they're saying is actually true. Bias is incredibly important to weed out, but often fact checks can also help root out some bias too. Biased individuals are more likely to lie or include misleading statements in their advice. By discovering false or misleading statements, you can also discover hidden bias in the individual. None of us are always right, so people have mistaken opinions about many topics. When looking for help, you always run the risk of including false information from a well meaning individual, as you have nobody to fact check them against. You have no way to tell if what they're saying is true, and, if they deliver it more confidently, you may already be convinced it's a fact. Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information. Although fact checking against other people can certainly help, there are other ways, including searching on Google or looking it up with a textbook, to fact check correctly. However, some statements are simply opinions and cannot be fact checked, only compared to other people's opinions.

When attempting to rephrase a sentence that sounds strange or incorrect, or when trying to add more detail and glamour to an otherwise boring sentence, there is no right or wrong answer. Certain techniques may work better or worse, but there is never a fix all type solution. So when taking advice from someone who, for example, is helping you edit your paper, some things they say you cannot fact check with Google or a textbook. If you were to only consult this individual, they would have full control, and may make suggestions that aren't the best for your paper. That's why, especially when dealing with highly opinionated topics like rephrasing sentences and adding additional detail, its crucial to consult multiple people and make sure most agree with your changes to ensure they're the best for your paper. Oftentimes in a writing help after school club I'm a part of, we have to deal with problems like these where students need more detail, but there's really no right and wrong way to phrase the sentence. That's why we consult each other to make sure every change we make is for the good of that persons writing.

Wednesdays, after school, I work as a consultant to the writing center. In the club, younger students, usually from seventh grade, come to get help with their writing from older, more experienced students. Many times, seventh graders come in with half finished essays that could barely be considered rough drafts, but as it turns out they've already turned them in and need to re-write them for a higher grade. The process can be difficult, and sometimes grueling if the seventh grader doesn't want to and cooperate, but I still love consulting. Working there is a joy, but one of the things that really makes us able to go above and beyond to help other students is the ability to cross check with other consultants and work together. Often, seventh graders are assigned only one consultant to help them with their work. However, like I've said above, one persons opinion can definitely be flawed. This is why we employ many talented consultants, so if one doesn't know what to do or accidentally makes a mistake, others can catch it and further assist them.

Asking multiple people for advice, no mater the topic, is always an important and crucial step of the writing process. By asking multiple people, you assure the least bias possible, the highest form of fact checking, the best way to phrase sentences and other similar opinionated subjects, and you ensure none of those you seek advice from made mistakes. ";0
"TeleLearning

Most students wish to distance themselves from school, uncomfortable chairs, boring lectures, repetitive schedule, and a bell that tells you when to go from class to class and when to eat. Now what if there was an option to bring your class to the comfort of your own home so you can set the schedule for when you are comfortable to learn. Fortunately in today's world, if there is a will there is a way. Many schools offer distance learning so students can learn online or using a video conference. Students now have an opportunity to benefit from the online classes provided to them, saving them time, energy, and not stressing them out. This new way of learning brings many benefits to all the students using it.

Imagine you are a student that has moved away during your first and second year of high school to go study elsewhere because of your parent's occupation. You have now moved back and are just about to start junior year and then you notice that some of the classes that you need to take to pass high school, you never took in the school that you previously moved to as it was not needed there. You now have to repeat those classes which are all mostly filled with freshmen, when you are just a junior yourself. You could have taken that new elective that you actually enjoy learning about, but now you have to take a class designed for eighth graders as a eleventh grader. That was the exact situation that I was in, moved back to a new area, behind on the requirements needed to pass. I believed I was all out of luck and had to repeat what I was taught in the seventh grade because I did not take it in high school. When all my hopes were low, my counselor told me about online classes, I no longer needed to worry about repeating a class as I could take it online over the summer or during the year, saving me time, and opening up a block for me to take any class that I actually enjoy learning about. My situation was just one of the many examples of the ways online classes could benefit a student. A student may not even have to miss two years like me, they could have missed a week as they were on vacation, but with online classes they could easily catch up to the rest of their peers.

The internet provides a plethora of potential for schools to connect to their students, but most schools are failing to take advantage of such an advanced and new way to learn. Learning on the internet has already advanced our schools to the 21st century, but using the internet to learn and assist us in class is very different from taking an entire class online. Online classes have worked wonders for the schools already using them, granting students extra credit, studying over the summer, saving time, keeping students in the comfort of their own home, and improving their grade from the grades of the students taking traditional classes. Some students like to push themselves to collect extra credits before graduation, this may be an issue as in schools there are a limited number of classes they can take, but with online classes, extra credit is made an option. We all know that when students go on summer break, they mostly forget a large chunk of what they have taken in during the school year, if they were to take some online classes over the summer, this can help them refresh and not to forget all they have been taught during the school year, making them more prepared for the upcoming year. Online classes can also cut down on transportation, freeing up traffic, pollution, and time taken to commute. Most students do not have an issue with their commute to school, but for those living in rural areas, their commute may take up to 45 minutes. If students were to take online classes, it will save the time and money of transportation to and from school. They could also choose what time they would like to start and finish, giving them that flexibility over their own time. Students also dislike the lack of freedom they have in school, a bell telling them when it is time to go from class to class, when to eat, and when to leave. Students should be given freedom over their time which is exactly what they get on online courses. If students are placed at home where they are comfortable, paying attention to the lesson will become easier as they will not be distracted by the discomfort they are placed in at school. Research lead by psychologists at MIT have shown that those students taking online classes do better than their counterparts in traditional classes.

Although online classes are proven to be beneficial to those taking it, there are some people who are against classes being taken online. They claim that it is harder for the student to stay focused, easier to cheat, may be costly, and not taken seriously. If students are having a hard time staying focused at home, where they could be in a room all by themselves, how do you think those students will behave when in class with a some of their friends. Students in class with fellow peers and friends are more likely to be distracted by those who are alone at home. Cheating is a issue that attacks all schools everywhere, but with online classes, locked mode on tests and open note exams are an option. Open note exams are more realistic to what students will encounter in real life as in real life you will always have access to a device which you can search the internet with. Online classes are not cheap, mine could have cost me up to 600 dollars, but luckily there are plenty of benefits in place to help those that may not be able to pay full price. If students were not to take the course seriously, they would suffer the consequences such as failing exams or not passing the course.

As you can see, students have one of the best resources present to them, and if more schools and more students were to use these online classes provided to them, we would see an increase in grades, and participation in school resulting in a better overall society for us.           ";0
"The techology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotion is making Mona Lisa Smile.

Making Mona Lisa Smile is made for computer imagery, when making of Mona Lisa Smile, The students are finding the ""computer construcs a 3-D computer model of the face."" the model of the computer move like the human muscles. Also the computer are smart as the human as, and computer tells the true. when the student's finding how is becoming to found the computer 3-D. they sloved the model and the founded. And useful in the world.. when you use 3-D model is look real life you seeing. Is beautiful to look at the imagine on the comuputer or video imagery.

Body of 2, Because the computer useful and how can the computer must do it well. The computer knows your feel happy or feel sad. for example, when the proson did bad things, the police offcial used the computer and they will find you on the computer imagine. And the computer can being to ceek your bones; also the computer are so smart. it will knews everthing; for example, when people's visit the other counrtys, at the ariport when before you going throught, it might have like gate. the gate are put in computer, when you go throught that gate the computer cheek your bodys and inside of your bones; and it'll cheek your bags.

body of 3,for example, When you have eyes problem,the first they took the picture, on computer, your imagine will shows up your eyes problem; and the doctor will cheek your eyes with computer. The computer's would know how your eyes will gonna work and how much far you sees; or you need glass, it'll shows on the imagine computer.

when you eyes cheeks would lay dawn your chin and you look at the green light and everythings the computer know about your eyes. for example, When people went to takephotos store, with their family to take family picture. After they took family picture; the carmerman ask about Adding the photos. And their family choces background, a beautiful picture, and the camerman add imagine on the computer. For the other example, when the US soldier's to fight war with Isis, before US Army's will fight their bad guys US Army's used small ariplan it have carmer, the Army's look at the place on the computer. After they look at on the computer, the Army's knews how many Isis people are there. And US captian let's go his soldier. to fight bad guys..

"Im Luke Bomberger and I want to convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Have you ever thought about exploring the world?

Do you like helping people?

Well what im about to tell you will make you to sign up right now.

Without my friend Don Reist i would have never found out about the Seagoing Cowboys.

He invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

I didn't say no I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe and many nations were destroyed.

To help these countries recover their food supplies, anaimals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration).

UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Don and I signed up.

In August 1945, we received orders to report to New Orleans.

We arrived August 14, the day the Pacific war ended.

we boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed to Greece.

I was 18 when we headed for Greece.

It took us about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

During that time we had enough time to go sightseeing at a lot of places.

But on the ship you do have to take care of the animals.

And what I loved most about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you got to explore the world and help people who need it.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more then an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me Im grateful for the opportunity.

It made me aware of people of other countries and their needs.

I hope you join the Seagoing Cowboys because overal you get to explore the world while helping people.  ";0
"Hello my name is luke and im am in the Seagoing cowboys program. My friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I work two part time jobs in a grocery store. It was 1945, World War 2 ended in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.

I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.

Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

I was busy caring for the animals during the crossing. My job was to check on the animals every hour. I also found time to have fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball .

In conclusion, i learned that after i graduated high-school life got harder, but i cant let that get in my head. I will face lifes challenges and will overcome them. The trip wasn't about what did, it's about what you learded and its about the adventeur.";0
"Hey, y'all!  Today, I'm gonna write about whether online classes or attending school is better for students with special needs, those who speak different languages, and those who have trouble adjusting to the school environment. 

First off, let's talk about students with special needs.  I think online classes are way better for them because they can learn at their own pace and in a comfortable environment.  You see, some kids might have trouble paying attention in a crowded classroom, or they might need more time to finish their work. Online classes can provide them with that flexibility and personalized attention they need to succeed. Plus, they can avoid feeling self-conscious or embarrassed about their needs in front of their peers.  It's like, they can just chill at home and learn without feeling judged or anything. 

Next up, let's talk about students who speak different languages.  I think attending school is better for them because they can practice their language skills in real-time.  Like, imagine being able to speak Spanish with your classmates and teacher in person!  It's way easier to learn and retain a language when you can hear it spoken naturally and interact with native speakers. Plus, it's a great way to make new friends and connect with people from different cultures.  It's like, the ultimate language exchange program! 

Now, let's talk about students who have trouble adjusting to the school environment.  I think online classes can help them too because they can avoid feeling overwhelmed or anxious in a new setting.  You know, some kids might have trouble making friends or following the rules in school. Online classes can provide them with a more relaxed and familiar environment, where they can learn without feeling like they're on edge all the time. Plus, they can take their time to get used to the new surroundings without feeling rushed or pressured.  It's like, they can ease into it at their own pace and not feel like they're in over their";1
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Not me! In my opinion students shouldn't have attend classes from home because for me is not necessary you know why? because most of the students should be preparing to put effort and go to the school. Now in today we have a lot of technology to learn more better about what you what to know. We have the school for learn more important things instead of to attend classes from home. Some ladies who get pregnant and then the baby is born has the opportunities to have classes from home because they can not lost their credits or to be absent during their diet that's mean that is a good way.

First, the school would give you a more better choice instead of classes from home because many students should be lazy. For example students who take classes from home can eat whatever time they want and can study at the same time, they can go to the bathroom without any permission and when they want it but it's a problem because we the students have the energy and the capacity to go to school and learn more instead at home. Also we have more problems that some students don't understand and that's why they prefer attend classes from home. Furthermore they don't have any teacher who can help you, anybody who gave you any idea about to resolve a problem. You can not take things seriously and you have to work independently not as a group.

Second, some students have many opportunities and doesn't make a good use, you have to appreciate what the school is offer you because them you still make the same mistake every day and if you want to grow up you have to make good choices. Every students have different thoughts about study some of them waste their time using their cellphones instead they can be study and it's bad because in a future they don't won. Students likes to put endanger their knowledge because they prefer to copy to somebody and not doing the difficult things by themselves.

Third, parents have to put control on this because, if they don't emend their children's them when they go to school doesn't like because in school there are many rulers that the students should follow and if you are in home there don't exist any rule that can trust you and that's why some students are spoiled with the teachers. The school is for people who really want to studied. The students have to be always preparing because is the best way that you can be a great person in the life. If you put part of you in everything even so doesn't matter where you are if in the school or in your home, because when you want something you doing well and you have success in your life.

In conclusion, students shouldn't benefit to have classes from home, is a worse idea that a student can have because this problem could have serious consequences in your life as a young you're. You students had to work striving for better opportunities. Classes from home doesn't help you so that's why you have to go to school and support yourself, if you want to be someone in the life, ""Don't be lazy, you can do it, be proud of who you are"".";0
"Students need a break from school. Continuing through twelve years of standardized education without the occasional recess would be detrimental to the mental health of all involved parties (including the teachers). That being said, breaks from school should not be periods where students are completely free of the learning they undergo during the school year. To ensure this, students are often given graded projects to complete over their breaks. However, the way in which these projects should be administered is a point of contention. Some believe these projects should be created by teachers, others believe the students themselves should be making their own assignments. Because it is the most effective way to prepare for the upcoming course, and it is the best way to ensure all projects can be graded fairly and objectively, teachers should be the ones designing the projects students take over their breaks.

I've seen a joke circiling around the internet around back-to-school time for a couple of years now. It describes how as one walks into their math class on the first day of school, the teacher will frantacially start off the class by exclaiming ""alright everybody we're already behind schedule"". Although this is meant to be comedic, it certainly bears parallels to reality. Often teachers simply do not have enough class time to get through all the material by the end of the year. This causes the class to be rushed, and does not allow for the teacher to allocate more time to areas where students are struggling. Having teachers design projects to be completed before students arrive on the first day of class is a way to mitigate this problem. Teachers, who know the curriculum well and truly understand what topics might need more focus, can design a project that introduces the students to material they actually need to know. This relieves the stress and pressure put on students and teachers alike, as the students enter the classrooms for the first time already familiar with the material. Accomplishing this with a student-designed project would not be as successful, as anyone unfamiliar with course-material is not going to be able to create a project that prepares someone for that very course-material. Teachers are the only ones that can effectively design a project that prepares students for their upcoming course.

Personal bias has no place in education. Teachers try to avoid this from coming into play by issuing objective markers of student performance: grades. However, grades only work if they are truly objective. Therefore, educators must use a standarized rubric to assess all of their students. This is practically impossible to do if students can design their own project. If a student has the freedom to take as many liberties as he or she desires with a graded assignment, it is almost impossible for any teacher to then compare every students' projects to one another, or even to some basic model. My eighth grade science teacher ran into this very problem. My class was given an assignment with very little direction and practically no rubric. This made it very difficult for us to understand what we were supposed to get out of the assignment. Additionally, many of us thought we were graded unfairly for the project. I realize now that these conclusions were inevitable because this was a student-designed project. The teacher was unable to fairly assess our work because the project lacked structure. It is unfair for both students and teachers alike to have students design their own projects, as it is practically impossible to grade them objectively and fairly.

Long summer breaks can often prove to be detrimental to a student's education. Teachers often try to avoid this outcome by assigning projects over this period of rest. However, this raises the question of who should be the ones designing these projects: teachers or students? Because it is the most effective way to prepare for the upcoming course, and it is the best way to ensure all projects can be graded fairly and objectively, teachers should be the ones designing the projects students take over their breaks.";0
"Who needs a car anyway? that is what causes polution in the world. driving all the time is not such a good idea. People are getting lazy now a days. What is wrong with walking? I love walking, i can get excercise and have fun because im with my friends. car riding can be exttremely dangerous too.

First of all, driving a car could be very dangerous. For example, some people like to drive while texting which could result in a serious accindent. Another reason is not paying attention to the other drivers near you. Kids should not be behind the wheel of a car yet. I say that because they do not take as serious as aldults. Teens also like to drive fast to show off or have loud music blasting, these are also advantages of limiting car usage. Car accindents would derease dramatically.

Second of all, cars take up too much gas which takes up a lot of our money, Walking would be super cheap because you do not have to pay to walk. Driving around 24/7 makes us really lazy. Walking to where we need to go gives us excercise, and quite frankly everyone needs some excercise or a little work out. The goverment will even make more pathways or trails for us to travel on. I understand if you are leaving town for a family vacation or going somewhere that is not walking distance, the city has various types of motor transportation, like city buses, cabs, bikes, and do not forget about our planes.

Third of all, im not saying completely get rid of cars just limit how much you drive. Instead of buying car after car after car carpool with friends. That way you can still get to where you gotta go quickly and lower emissions. People do not drive as much as they used to, i found out by a study that driving decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Lets try to make that 50 percent. People do not really care about a car, they just want a quick way to get from A to B. All we gotta do is Find a safer more cheaper way for them to do that and the percentage will drop rapidly.

In Conclusion, limiting car usage can be improved by getting people to walk more. Carpool with friends, ride bikes, takes buses, cabs, even planes to where they have to go. This will help our enviorment to be  much safer and healthier. We not saying give up your car just try not to use it so much.                                                 ";0
"do you think that car should be able to drive by their self? I don't think that cars should. Now I Know many people might disagree with me, but hear me out. I don't think that driverless should be develop because of reckless driving, car start to mafunction, and why would you need a driverless car if someone still have to drive the car.

there are many reckless driver out in the world today. when people are on the rode they think that they wouldn't have to look at the rode because their car is driverless. That car can stop working at any point of time, so why risk it. In a passage, I recently read, it say "" the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times, so why make the risk of an accident go up.

Next why do you need a driverless car when you still have to driver the car. you are better off buying a cheeper car that works just as well. You wouldn't be able to take a quick nap if you wanted to. In the passage it say you would get bored waiting on your turn to drive the car. that can make accident happen.

I think that cars should not be driverless because of reckless driverss, stop working, and why drive a driverless car that someone still have to driving. It just not important to me as food and water is, so I'm saying no to driverless cars.       ";0
"I belive that driverless cars are a good idea. Personaly, I don't trust people on the roads. People get distracted easily, can have slow reaction times, and sometimes just are not safe. Driverless cars can fix all these problems easily.

One issue is that people easily get distracted. Smart cars, on the otherhand, are complety built for the purpose of diving and analizing the roads. The feature most appealing to me and that fixes this issue is found here in the passage, "" Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."".

The second issue with drivers in cars are the drivers reaction times being to slow. Some people just do not have the reactions to be able to use the breaks fast enough to avoid accidents. These cars do it instantly, as stated in the passage, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from ethe engine, allowing far bettter response and control than a human driver could manage alone."".

Finaly, sometimes people just are not safe. Doing anything from texting while driving or taking erratic turns without signal can be extreamly dangerous to themselfs or anyone around them. These cars can prevent that by even forcing people to watch the road constantly or alerting us when danger is ahead. "" GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."". This is only one of many safty enhancing developments to smart cars and the protection of the ""driver"".

In conclution, smart cars are a great idea. With these cars people will be safer than ever. No more driver error, distraction, slow reactions, or danger to themselfs or to others around thm.";0
"Dear Principal,

I think that you should definitely choose Policy 1. I think this is a good decision based on some very important facts. The environment of an emergency, it gives students a sense of freedom, and that it can cause less trouble if they have their cell phones with them.

In the environment of an emergency, I believe that if students have their cell phones, that they can call their parents. Not during school hours regularly, but in the case of an emergency. If they did not have their phones with them and their was an emergency, then their parents might not be able to contact them and they will be worried. Also, if they were sick, and the school didn't have any phones, they could call and tell their parents to pick them up from school.

If students were allowed to bring their cell phones to school, it would cause less trouble at school. If cell phones were not allowed, then they would get in a lot of trouble if they brought them. (And rebellious teens will do that.) What I mean by that is that if students were allowed to have their cell phones at school, then there would be less problems with taking phones away.

Lastly,

I think that if students have their cell phones, it will give them a sense of freedom. If they had to stay at school all day and have no contact with other people in other schools during their free time, then I think that they would be mad at the school. But if they could talk to other people during their free time, not during their class time, then I think the students would like school more.

Needless to say, there will always be people who try to break the rules and use their phones during class. The same would happen with people bringing cell phones to school in Policy 2. Even so, I still believe that the students would be happier at school and maybe pay attention more in class if you used Policy 2.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME";0
"Character traits are an essential part of human beings. They are the qualities that define us and make us who we are. Character traits are influenced by various factors, including external factors such as parents, friends, and media. In this essay, I will explore the influences of character traits in human beings, analyze firsthand experiences and research studies to explain how these traits are influenced by external factors, and discuss effective methods for cultivating character.

Parents play a significant role in shaping the character traits of their children. They are the first role models that children encounter, and their behavior and actions have a significant impact on the development of their children's character. Parents who exhibit positive traits such as kindness, honesty, and responsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits. On the other hand, parents who exhibit negative traits such as selfishness, dishonesty, and irresponsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits.

Friends also play a crucial role in shaping the character traits of individuals. Friends are a significant source of socialization and influence, and their behavior and actions can have a significant impact on the development of an individual's character. Friends who exhibit positive traits such as loyalty, empathy, and respect are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits. On the other hand, friends who exhibit negative traits such as bullying, dishonesty, and selfishness are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits.

Media also plays a role in shaping the character traits of individuals. The media, including television, movies, and social media, can have a significant impact on the development of an individual's character. Media that promotes positive traits such as kindness, honesty, and responsibility is more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits. On the other hand, media that promotes negative traits such as violence, greed, and selfishness is more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits.

While external factors such as parents, friends, and media can influence the development of character traits, they can also hinder it. For example, parents who exhibit negative traits such as abuse, neglect, and criticism can hinder the development of positive character traits in their children. Friends who exhibit negative traits such as bullying, dishonesty, and selfishness can also hinder the development of positive character traits in individuals. Media that promotes negative traits such as violence, greed, and selfish";1
"Have you ever done something you didn't want to do because your parents made you do it? This makes you annoyed at your parents because they just ignored what you wanted to do. It is bad enough that your parents make you do the activity, but what if your principal made you do it. This is why I disagree with our principal making us do extracurricular activities. It is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.

It is our life not the principals. If we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. Principals job is to be in charge when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. Life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. We are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. We should get to decide our own path not the principal.

Most kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. They might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. Extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.

Kids don't always have time. Some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. They need their families help to fight through these tough times. If they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. If the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. Everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.

I disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. I don't think forcing people to do them is the answer to every bodies problems. Extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. It should be up to the family what is done not our principal.";0
"Are you very active after school? Do you participate in extracurricular activities? I think all student should participate in extracurricular activities. I agree with our principal's decision he made on making every student participate in an extracurricular activitie because it allows them to get out more, make new friends, and they are able to support their school.

First of all students must join these activities because it allows them to get out more. Everyday now you see a bunch of kids playing video games, talking about how awesome they are, or even blowing money on them. Pushing the student to join school clubs or a sports team will take them away from those games. On the other hand, some kids don't have things to do after school. They just go home sit down and do nothing. If they join an activity they can have more fun after school. Trust me, as I have had some personal experience, it is not fun to be at home and have nothing fun to do. Also, as time goes on scientists have noticed that child obesity has increased as well. They need to stay active The after school sports are there to help those numbers go down.

Secondly, little ones can make new friends in after school programs. If they make new friends they won't be lonely anymore. For example, some kids are the only child. Yeah, I get it, that sounds amazing in a child's perspective, but it is always more fun to do something with a friend. If they don't have those friends, then they will be doing everything by themselves. Also, if a child is having problems at home or struggling with something in life, joining their new friend in a school activity will help them keep their mind off of it. Adding on to what I just stated, kids like to hide their emotions and tell everyone everything is alright when sometimes it really isn't. If children make new friends, then they will have someone to vent off of and let everything out. Once they do talk to them, then there will be someone right there to help them.

Finally, students can help support their school. Schools have many things to do throughout the year and very little time to do it. Joining council clubs or yearbook clubs will help the school get things done that are needed. Additionally, athletes can represent their school in a team sport that they like. To specify, at my high school football is a big thing. Many people love the game. The kids at the high school represent their school when they play good in their games. This will get your school out there and well known. Finally, kids can make their school a better place. Many clubs like to support many subjects like no bullying, or don't do drugs. If more and more kids join a club that thinks this way kids will start listening and making the school a safer and glorious place.

As I have stated, allowing students to get out more, make new friends, and helping support their school are all reasons students need to join an after school activity. I agree with our principal. After school programs are definitely worth a shot at trying out. Plus, it doesn't take a lot to participate in an activity, so get out their and join a club or a sports team now!";0
"Venus is important for many different reasons. Not only is Venus Earth's ""twin"", it is also the closest planet to Earth in denisty and size. In the article the author belives that studying Venus despite the many dangers it brings is very much worth it. I will talk about why he is correct.

The author of this article suggets that studying Venus is worthy of our time because it could help us learn about it and it's past. Also the planet is the most geologically similar to Earth in our entire solar system. In paragraph 4 the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". This quote shows that learning about Venus told us that in it's past it was capable of sustaining life. I belive also that the author is correct in saying that we should study it more because, if Earth every came to where it was not able to sustain life, we could look into moving to Venus because it was capable of sustaining life. Despite these dangers that he presented such as a very high tempature, exploring more into Venus is very important.

In conclusion, I believe the author was correct in saying that we should look more into Venus becasue we could learn about it past and it's capability of sustaining life in the future. That is why Venus is so important not just to the author but also to NASA.";0
"Schools are not only about learning math, English, science and history. Schools are also about learning how to interact with other people, and if a student does not attend school they will be behind those who do. I think online classes would not benefit students in the social aspect of life and in performance in academics.

During anyone's time in school whether it is a private school or a public school they encounter other students which helps develop social skills which are important to survive in the real world. The online schooling would not only make those who take it feel like their alone but it will make their adult life far more difficult. In the real world, future adults will have contact with a lot of people and students who had an interaction with other students will have an easier time doing so in their adult life. Unlike kids who spent their time in a room all by themselves learning, they will have to adapt to having interactions with other people. For example if a student who took the online classes in a future job had to present something for his boss, the student would have a difficult time getting his point across to other people because of the missing interaction with other people during their developmental years. Now if a student who attended school with other people did this it would be much easier for them because they would know how to talk to others and get their point across.

Another reason is that some kids learn better with others. Sure there may be the usual kid that does not want to be around other people but there's not many of them. For example my friends and I enjoy coming to school because we see each other and also because it has a sense of competition in terms of who has the better grades. I think when other kids are around and doing better than you it makes you want to try harder. Second if a student you sat next to in math class or in history was doing better than you in your mind you would say, oh i want to be like that, making you want to try harder and ultimately do better in school. In any competition teams push themselves to the limit, whether its a race, the final of a championship game or the last play in the game, teams try their hardest because the other team is doing so as well. Students will do that too, but they need other students to compete with which would not happen in online school.

The last reason why online schooling from home would not benefit a student is because they will simply skip the class. No matter who you are, you have your lazy moments. You have those moments where you just don't want to do anything, these moments usually happen at the comfort of your own home. Times like this are easily avoided by attending school, the student wakes up in the morning gets ready, walks to their bus stop and off they go to school. A student who has class at home may or may not forget about their class or even worse know they have it and decide not to do it because they are at home. There is no choice in whether you will go to school today or not, most of the time it's a yes, your parents say you have to go to school and that is what you have to do. Online classes can be avoided if the student just does not do it. Students are supervised in school at all times whether its administration during lunch, or by a teacher in class. Who is going to supervise the student at home? if a parent is home they might do it but if there is no parent it's up to the student to make that decision and its usually a I am too tired to do this.

Online school may be only fit for a certain amount of students. For example students who work or live too far from a school may be able to benefit from doing it, but the majority of kids would not. Online school has its wins but it is also very faulty. It can be easily be avoided by lazy students, it can have a big impact in the future of the student and it can have an change performance in a bad way. Therefore most students will not benefit from online school and it will slow them down.";0
In my opion in how i fell about the Facial action cording system enables in how the computers can help identify how people fell in tell the human emotions is i blive its some how can be real in some how not be real. for eaxample in the storey it shares in tells us how people use it in it worked on them i have also seen it done on most tv shows so that is why i think that this could or may work ought. I also think in blive that it can also be not real a wil for example i have not use it befor or on other peoople .Also it still queston me on how a computer thinks that it could some how read a person emotions. Also using this type of work on students in kids can also be not much of a good thing if you think about because yes some people do get sad in really upset but not everone knows why they are mad or why they fell mad in somtimes people can fell sad with ought eving knowing that they are sad or unhappy. We aslo have people who dont want people to know there sad which is why most people had there sadness with happyness to show that there not sad because they dont want others to know how they reallt fell inside as will .So in my own words to me it could mean a god thing but aso mean a bad thing as will to.;0
"For me it's good to have a grade B average. Most students would say no because that's what they like to do play sports they don't care about school or anything but most do. If you would let them play with a grade C average they would probably think they have the chance to play and still have a bad grade. They would not try hard in school. If you don't let them play when they have a grade C average and they love the sport they are playing just for the sport they will try hard at school even they might get ti up to an A. Many students say they don't like any classes but they just can't wait to get to gym that's all they like to do probably for some is the only grade the have an A in. That just tells you that they will try hard in sport but not in school so if you want well any student to go to collage you might want to keep that policy. Many students when they grow up want to be professional football players but I don't think any college would accept a student with all A in only sports but not in social studies, science, math and language arts. What would the student be when he grows up. What if they accept him as a professional football player and he's career is then done. He might have money but if he then want' s to work he wont have somewhere to work he was good at what he did but he is done. So if I was the principal i would keep that policy. You're students might have a better chance of being a professional football player and when hid career is done he will have another career to lean to.

Also what about the parents that would be a big problem for you. They will get there report card and always see an A in sport and all C in the other classes. They will call you and say what is going on with my kid. All you will sat is that the policy is to still play sport even if they have a C but is the students problem if he doesn't have an A in his classes. Before you know the kid will be in another school with all A and you with one less kid in you're school. You might want to keep all you're students. What if when you're student grow up to be someone important the will probably grow up to be someone important and they tell the whole world and you will be honored who knows. You probably get my point to not change the policy because you probably don't care what happens but you will be proud to know you made good students. You made them grow up to be successful students with all good grades. You will make the student work hard to even get a B and then play sport. You will make them work hard but at the same time they will get to play what they love the most. So you better keep the B aver";0
"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

As you know, you are changing the school policy to students needing at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities. What you may not know is many students here have a C average.

A C average is not bad at all! It's actually the average scored of an A-F grade scoring. So many students do an expected ""good job"" on their grades. It is sometimes hard, or very hard for students to raise one grade level, especially since the school year is half way over, the sports and activities are winding down leaving no time to do so.

In addition, our middle school is very small, so we need all the people we can get on our sports team or activities. Making the cut-off a C average will cut off half of the participants from joining and already on a team or in a school activity!

This will create a difficult problem for coaches, and club leaders to have a small population on their team or in their club.

I have a friend who actually has a C average and is hoping to make the track team for the 3rd year in a row. She is also hoping that high school coaches watch her track meets to get on a team in high school, or even her favorite high school Springstead! If you change the rule she will not be able to participate in her favorite sport, or get into a further more educational and athletic school than her zoned high school Central, averaging a D grade level. Changing this rule can change someone's life.

To end this letter, my argument is to keep the rule of students to have at least a

C average grade to participate in school activities or sports in which many students have. I hope you have acknowledged this letter and change the rule.

Sincerely, 8th grade student; STUDENT_NAME";0
"Some people think that attending class from home is a bad thing because they think they wouldn't learn better that way

I think that some schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing because that may make it better for some students to learn and some students may feel distracted at school and can't learn there because some students dont come to class to learn they come there to just distract others and bully others. Also thats another reason why students doesn't want to come to school because of bullying, and some people think its okay to bully others when they actually wanna get something done in school to learn something. People say that might be a bad thing to attend classes by a way of online or video classes, but i personally disagree with that because as long as somebody is guarding you at the moment for a example if you have your parent right there watching you while you are attending classes by video conferences or online classes that would be much help because your mom can actually see what your doing and see which one is more better and comfortable for you. Online classes can help people with so much now days because thats where kids now go in today society is online to look up answers and information they haven't been taught in school and online always make us understand it more than being in a class with full of kids who dont wanna learn and learn something new for once.

I personally know this is better because my sister took a online class before because she wasn't learning well in school because she was getting distracted by a lot of students and was making bad grades but she was very smart, So my mom decided to make her to online classes instead of going to school because she feel like she can learn better that way and it is a more easy environment for her to get er work done and learn in better. That actually helped her get better because she started to make good grades catch up and actually graduate on time because she was on the roll to not graduating on time and she was gonna fail if she didn't pass her Sols she had to take at the end of the year. Also Homeschooling can be a bit different from just taking online classes and video conferencing classes because some students for some reason doesn't like to do work in front of teachers and they somehow get there work better in peace.

I feel that is true because a lot of students i asked do they like to work in peace or in a area where somebody is around you and talking and they all told me peace and i also agree with that because it helps us work better and understand it more better. One day i was with my friends in a class and we were all in a group doing a assignment and we were all just talking laughing and playing and not getting nothing done and we had to be finish with it before the end of the class and we barely got anything done, So the teacher separated us and told me to work alone. So once i started to work alone i started to realize that helped me better because is started to get my work done and catch up, and i wasnt distracted by my friends nun of that time. A word of advice from me is if you know that your distracted by your friends but you don't to say nothing because your scared of what they gonna say about just ask the teacher can you work by yourself because at the end of the day your going to be one that passes while they fail and if you do fail with them your gonna regret everything at the end and wish you never did it.

People may think oh your so boring because you wanna take online classes and not come to school, But no thats not the case because school is not always about coming there to chat with friends all day. I mean yea its fun to go to school to talk with friends and have fun but sometimes that has to come to a stop because your education always come first before fun and my mom and grandma always taught me that when i was little and i never used to listen to it until i got in a situation that involved me so close to failing ad i started to realize its not a joke and the friends that your laughing with will not care 3 times about you failing and wouldn't not even try to lift you up when your close to failing. Being cool and bullying people is not school and thats why half of these students are dropping because either they're are not learning anything, getting bullied, something is going on at home, or they just don't wanna be there so mostly of time just come to school just to make other students not wanna be there and encourage them to drop out with them or even make them think school is pointless and they dont have to learn anything to accomplish something in this world.

I feel like us people should try to force the government to start video confrencing class as another way to teach because nobody is not gonna do anything unless we make it known and let the government and everybody in the world what is going on in today society. I also think we all should sign a petition to start it all across the united states and see the difference from people learning better in school or at home while video conferencing with a teacher. There are alot of stories online where little kids are killing theirselves because people are constantly picking with them and they think they are coming to school to learn and they are suppose to be safe by the teachers, principals, and administrators at the school, But sometimes the teachers doesn't care or listen to the students unless its convient for them and unless the parent actually has to go to the school just to stop the situation. Students shouldn't be feeling scared to go somewhere where they think they are safe and protected but they are really there just to get hurt and people never know what they are going through at home.

Stay away from people who is not uplifting you but they're just putting you down,And try to get some type of online class to help you if you think your struggling.";0
"One reason people seek different opinions is because some people have different opinions on what people should do. Seeking different people's opinions allows you to get all the information from all sides. If people seek more than one person's advice then you would be able to compare the information to see what you think is the best choice. Also, if people seek more than one person's advice then the person might be able to collect all the information and put it together.

Another reason people ask different people is because the first person may not be giving you the best advice. Like, what if the first person's advice is pretty good, but then the next person you ask has better advice. If the person asked advice from more than one person then you wouldn't have to be stuck with the bad information. If you just ask for one person's advice and it was bad advice then it could get you in really big trouble. Like, if you rely on one person's advice and they told you that if they start making you mad then you can put your hands on them. What if the person you put hands on presses charges then you could go to jail for a long time. If you asked another person's opinion then you may not be in the situation that you are in.

The next reason why people ask different people for adivce is because if the advice the person gave you worked for them, but it didn't work for you. Like, if a person is having trouble with their dog alerting them that they need to use the restroom. So that their dog doesn't keep going to the restroom in the house. They might say ""you could give your dog a treat when they alert you they need to go to the restroom"". If that doesn't work, but you only asked one person for advice. Then, you would be mad because the advice didn't work. Next, you would have to ask another person for advice, but at the beginning if you would have just asked more than one person then you would be able to peice the information together.

Finally, if people ask more than one person's advice then it will help you make the best choice possible.";0
"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! You should join it because you get to help others and animals. Also it not just a plus for them it is one for you too. The plus is that when you travel to help others you get to see the ocens all the time and beautiful sights! It is an opportunity of a lifetime if you ask me! If I was old enough I might what to think about being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Luke's claim was a great claim! Instead of working in a grocey store and a bank he became a Seagoing Cowboy! Even himself he said, '' It opened a whole new world for me'' He helped animals and more when the World War Two happend. He recovered their food supplies. He went accrosed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two, that would be a sight to see.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have a responsibility to help animals and more! But it can also be dangerous crossing the oceans all the time. If you want to be a Seagoing cowboy you have to be brave and courageous! You need those traites because if that was your job you would'nt want to be nervous or afraid all the time.

Luke had too be brave he had to have a great outlook to kept doing what he was doing, And you can too! His point of veiw was strong. He went on 9 trips and that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! He also had a cargo of 355 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them! He even cracked his ribs, but he is ok. Over something small but he was brave enough to keep going because he cared for the animals and he loved his job.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys! He even know himself it was an opportunity of a lifetime.                                    ";0
"Luke was 18 years old. He just finished his high school graduation. Luke had two jobs working at a grocery store and at a bank, until his life cahnged.

Luke's friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime. World War II just ended and a lot of countries needed help, so Luke and his friend started to help. The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of all of the animals that would be on the boat. Luke and Don then signed up.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Luke was happy that he was helping people but he was also really excited to see Europe and China. Luke also went to Venice, Italy and he even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy really helped and prepared him for this hard work that he is doing today. Then soon enough, Luke got a new job on the boat. Luke's job was check on all the animals every hour.

Then one night Luke's life almost ended. Luke was going to go see the captain but he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke almost flew overboard but a metal along the edge stopped him.

Luke had fun on board also. The cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

Luke was happy for what he has done. It made Luke more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness always stayed with him. Luke saved peoples lives. Luke is a hero.";0
"How does the Electoral College affect the selection of the presidency and is it a positive force? Many may answer ""No."" or ""I don't know."" to these questions, only doing such because that's what they've been or what they've heard others say. While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its certainty, its transregionality, and it lets ""the most thoughtful voters"" (Posner Source 3) decide the election.

Swings states let candidates to campaign where it really matters. Being a voter in a swing state means you have to have extra close attention to the campaigns and the candidates, leaving you to be more thoughtful than voters in states that aren't swing states. And in turn voters in these states will definitely receive ""the most information and attention from the candidates"" (Posner Source 2). Voters from these states at the end of the campaigns will no doubt be the most informed voters in the nation, giving them the right to decide the fate of the election for the future.

A successful president must be voted for across the regions of the United States to fufill the wants and needs of its diverse people. While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, ""residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests.

The use of the Electoral College allows for a more certain winner over popular vote, therefore avoiding election crisis. Although there was one ""fiasco"" in 2000, as Bradford Plumer calls it in Source 2, the chance of this happening is very small since ""even a very slight pulrality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (Posner Source 3) For example, in 2012, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote while he recieved only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.(Posner Source 3). A 1.3 percent from a tie is much, much more close than the 11.7 percent that that the Electoral College gives us.

While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.                    ";0
"I honestly dont think driverless cars are a good idea. Yes, there are benifits to driverless cars but I personally think there are more disadvantages than advantages. I my self personally like the fact that the driver does not have to drive the car all the time. I think it would be a good idea for handicapped people.

I do not think it is a good idea for many reasons. It states in the article that the cars are eqqipted with a gps, but what if there is a current construction or hazard in the route it takes you? How will the car beable to pass another car on a two lane highway? How about drunk drivers? If a drunk wants to get in a car and drive, that car would allow it, but whenever it is time for the driver to take over, 99.9% of the time that will not happen.

I think there will always be manuel driven cars and trucks around. If someine needs to tow something a driverless car would not be able to tow anything. Farmers, personal buissness' and many other people would have a big issue with this.

Although the world is nearly going to all electronics, mechanics will have to go back to school to learn about these new cars. Most manuel driven cars never have peoblems on the road, because everything is mechanical. Switching everything over to an electronic sensor will mess everyone up. If a laser goes out for surroundings around the car, the driver cannot do anything to help it.

Driverless cars is a bad idea. Drunk drivers will be a huge hazard. Along with many other road hazards. I think it is a good idea for handicapped people, and disabled people.                    ";0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the pros and cons of extending the school day from the perspective of an average 8th grade student:

Extending the school day has been a topic of discussion among educators and policymakers for a while now. While some argue that it can provide students with more learning time and better prepare them for college and the workforce, others claim that it can lead to burnout and negatively impact students' well-being. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of extending the school day and present my own opinion on the matter.

One of the main advantages of extending the school day is that it can provide students with more time to learn and engage in extracurricular activities. With a longer school day, students can participate in sports, music, and other clubs that they may not have time for during the regular school day. This can help them develop their interests and passions, as well as improve their physical and mental health. Additionally, a longer school day can give teachers more time to provide individualized attention to students who need it, which can lead to better academic performance.

However, there are also several cons associated with extending the school day. One of the most significant drawbacks is that it can lead to student burnout. Students may feel overwhelmed and stressed if they have to attend school for longer periods of time, which can negatively impact their mental health and academic performance. Moreover, extending the school day can also lead to increased costs for schools, such as higher utility bills and transportation costs. This can be a significant burden for schools with limited budgets, particularly in low-income areas.

In my opinion, extending the school day can be beneficial for students, but it should be done carefully and thoughtfully. Schools should consider the needs and preferences of their students when deciding whether or not to extend the school day. For example, schools in areas with a high cost of living may want to prioritize providing additional resources and support for students rather than extending the school day. Additionally, schools should provide students with adequate breaks and opportunities to rest and recharge during the longer school day.

In conclusion, extending the school day can have both positive and negative effects on students. While it can provide students with more learning time and opportunities";1
"With all this talk about greenhouse gasses, you think to yourself ""What can i do to change all of this?"". It's not as hard as you think. Some cities in foreign countries and this one are actually giving up their licence (short term or long term) so that the can walk, bike, carpool, or take public transportation rather than taking their own car. This is a great thing, especially with global warming and such. Some advantages of limiting car usuage can be: a less stressful and safe life, a reduction in harmful gasses, and a healthier lifestyle.

When you walk around your town (depending on the size of it) you see a lot of cars. You have to walk around on the sidewalks and worry about the fact that a small mistake by a driver can end your life. But in a city that has no cars driving around, you don't have to worry about that at all. You can not worry about how much the gas prices are because you may be car pooling or taking the bus. In ""

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""

by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she asked a citizen on what she thought of the no car law, she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (line 3), she saw how having no fast-moving hunks of metal can be a very stressless situation. A community that doesn't have this stress can worry about other things now.

It's often talked about in the news. Greenhouse gasses. Global warming. We hear about all the time and how it's affected by emissions of cars. How could we avoid it? Simple, we stop driving around so much. Cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and we in the United States make up 50 percent of it (Elisabeth Rosenthal, line 5). It's especially bad in Paris, where the gasses are so bad that there was 5 days of smog, only rivaled by Beijing, China the most polluted city in the world (Robert Duffer, line 14), which it's so bad in Beijing the citizens of the city have to wear masks covering their noses and mouths to protect themselves from the harmful gasses. It's horrible that people have to live in such horrible conditions.

If you gave up driving to everywhere you go, you wouldn't just help the world with greenhouse gasses, you'd also be helping yourself. People nowadays sit at home watching TV and snacking. But do you know how much walking and biking could do to help the health of people. This would be the case if there was a limitation on driving cars. Getting exersize is also a great stress-reliever. Also it helps with the nasty smog that's been mentioned. People wouldn't be breathing in harmful gasses if there was a limitation or ban to car usage in most contries. Air pollution effects all of us as human beings.

Most of us can't think of a society without cars, but it's very possible. We can, however, make a society exactly like that to some extent. Running around screaming about global warming won't do much unless you take action. Not only will it help the Earth to have better air, it can help lead a more stress-free, safe life and a healthier one that'll only need you to walk or bike to some places.    ";0

"There are many advantages to limiting the usuage of a car.  One big one that most countries are trying to deal with is lower the deverity of greenhouse gases or smog.  For example, in source one Elisabeth Rosenthal states,"" And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.""  Also in source two, Robert Duffer explains,"" After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""  Source three also explains how a decrease in car usage could help with air pollution.  Andrew Selsky writes,"" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""  Also in source four Elisabeth Rosenthal,"" ... It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largerst source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.""  Stated clearly by the four sources, the greatest advantage of decreases the usage of cars is the decrease in air pollution.  Along with that people can start becoming stress free and more relaxed than ever before.     ";0
"Exploring Venus has its pros and cons. Both have its challenges and risks. Venus is a very interesting planet to study due to the fact that it is the only one like earth, but there are risks. throughout this essay I will tell you my reasoning on why the author didn't exactly prove to me that Venus is worth taking risks for.

It states in paragraph two,"" Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas."" This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn't surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind.

It also states in paragraph three,"" On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus.

It states in paragraph four,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth.

The author then goes on to say,"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way. However in the sixth paragraph the author states,"" Therefor, scientists seeking to conduct a throrough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This statement shows how the trip to Venus would be a waste of time if you cannot get on the surface. There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface.

In conclusion the author did not convinve me that traveling to venus is worthy expidition. The author mainly explained the cons of the study and did not provide too many pros. The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.          ";0
"Opinions of Many

Generic_Name

Generic_Name has recently been having issues at work. He used to enjoy his job, but after a new employee was hired, he often feels like he's been in a competition. He has tried to brush it off, but it seems the new employee just isn't a fan of Generic_Name. He walks past Generic_Name and glares, closes unsaved documents out of his computer, dumps out his morning coffee, and sabotages his plans with other workers. Generic_Name has usually been quite calm and collected about this, but the more it happens, the less he seems to be able to contain his frustration. So he decides to ask his coworkers and friends what he should do. Should he directly confront this new employee, speak to the boss, or simply, do nothing? This is a situation that many people in real life have faced. As a result, they often have to ask for the advice of many different people. This is so they can get a gauge of what should be done about their situation, because in a lot of cases, one opinion just isn't enough. Asking for multiple points of view has become like second nature for some people, and others barely do it at all. However, at the end of the day, there are reasons why your option may not be the best option. Asking for multiple opinions is beneficial because it helps you look at different perspectives, figure out what most people think is a good choice, and gets you advice from different types of people.

When is comes to perspective, especially in conflicts between others, it is very important to have more than one point of view. This is because people think in different ways, so it is key to take as much of those ways into consideration as possible. On top of that, you, or even other people, may be biased. If you argue with a friend, you may think it is best not to apologize later simply because of the fact that you think you're right, and that apologizing would make you look like you're admitting you're at fault. Also, if you ask for the opinion of a friend that you explained the whole situation to in a way that made the other person look bad, they might side with you as well. This is why you should ask that friend for an opinion, as well as a friend of the person you were arguing with, to get both points of view. That way you can both explain how you feel, so that each side can be understood. Part of perspective is about the way you look at things, which is why it is good to listen and take into consideration the other ways people may look at how things went down.

Asking for multiple opinions is good because it allows you to not be self centered. This way, you can compare how many people think alike, to how many people think differently. In this case, think about it as if majority ruled. If many people think the same way about something when you ask for advice, it is a sign that it should be highly thought about when you come around to making your decision. Of course, you should not always choose what most people say you should do, which is why it is important to not let people think for you when asking for advice. Though the highly favored opinion should always at least be pondered. If many people have the same opinion, think about that situation, apply their opinion, and decide if it is right for you. In many cases, this helps you get a better grasp on what to do.

Personality is a crucial aspect when asking for the advice of multiple people. This is good because it helps you compare the opinions of people who think differently. If you ask for the opinion of someone who is always enthusiastic and a positive thinker, but doesn't really sit down and think about things before they do it, chances are they'll give you different advice than someone who is quiet and pessimistic, but always thinks things out thoroughly and incorporates every outcome before they make a decision. Along with that, you may get different advice from someone you just met, compared to someone you've known for a few years. Or getting an opinion from someone who doesn't like you that much, compared to someone who absolutely adores you. Experience is also extremely beneficial when asking for advice. For example, if you got into an argument with a friend, and you're contemplating apologizing, you may get a different response from someone who argued with their friend and apologized, than someone who was apologized to. Both of these responses would be good to consider because they each have experience, just in different ways. Which makes you more informed when it comes to making a final verdict for yourself.

With all the information Generic_Name got from the many people he asked, he decided to speak to the boss about his problem. The boss then set up a meeting with the two of them together to discuss their complaints and disagreements. What Generic_Name learned was that everything was just a big misunderstanding caused by a lack of communication. The two workers are now on good terms and enjoy talking with each other in their free time. If Generic_Name hadn't asked for advice from multiple people, he could've falsely accused the worker by confronting him, or had the problems continue by doing nothing at all. In conclusion, this just shows to prove that things like this happen all the time, and other people can actually indirectly help each and every one of us solve our problems. For example, companies, or the government voting, is just like asking for advice from multiple people, because you're asking what they think, and the votes are used to make an overall decision. The perspectives of others, amount of people with the same opinion, and personality and experience of those people, are all components that teach us why asking for advice from multiple people can be so beneficial. So find an answer in others! Chances are, they'll come looking for one in you too.";0

You might just might be able to learn to speak a different language and you can test your friends to see which language you are speaking. In plus you get to hang out with animals like horses, or cows, or mules. You also get to work for UNRRA which is a great federation. But you have to have a college degree to become a Seagoing Cowboy or you can never join. Make sure to get good grades in highschool as well that way the UNRRA knows that your right for the job. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy than you would be able to explore the world go to the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and many more. The reason I'm trying to get you to join is because their is alot of people that died in the war. You can help people in the war by becoming a Seagoing Cowboy that way you are the best person in the world and you can have a good mind and say ""I helped people in the war and I'm proud."" Join the Seagoing Cowboys I know it might sound like a ridicoulus name but if it helps people than be proud of being a... Seagoing Cowboy! Help other people and make good in the world. But you dont have to become a Seagoing Cowboy you can do many other jobs to help people in the war. But I'm just saying becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is the best job I've had.";0
"Generic_School is a school with about one thousand kids or more its going to be verry hard to asssigned a after school activity to all the students especialy like me. After school I hav to go a pick up my little sister and nobody els can and I know tat there re other people in the school that also have things to do after school.

One way we can make it so at least a resoable amunt of people stay afterschool is tuters for kids and also they can makes new clubs. To make a new club a student has to have at least six students that want to join the club but there also has to be one adult supervising the students. When the club starts it is going to have a place to meet and a scedual or els all the other clubs might want to go to the computer lab but only one can.

When you create a club it has to go into a catigory science, sports, office, or just play. When someone desides to create a new club before evrything a club thats in the office catagory has to deside what catagory it goes into and if its apropriet of they need equipment and all that stuff they also choose where the club will be lead. ss but all in all do not agree with the polacy of all students need to have a after school club it wll be to much work and students have things to do they need a break sand they also ave homework for all of therw classes so I think they shouldnt have to do afterschool activities ";0
"I oppose the idea of schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes,this is because not all students benefit from attending classes from home,and online.

Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. In some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance.

In conclusion, distance learning and it's method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.";0
"Dear Mr. President,

As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first admendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Best-laid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted canidate A, but North Dakota voted for canidate B, canidate A is bound to win because Florida has twenty-nine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing.

Sincerley,

"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 I'm super excited to write this essay about why knowledge is more important than imagination. I know, I know, it might seem like a weird topic, but hear me out! 🤔

First of all, let's talk about what knowledge is. Knowledge is like having all the facts and information about something. It's like having a superpower that helps you understand the world around you. Without knowledge, you wouldn't know how to do things like solve problems, make good decisions, or even communicate with others. 🤷‍♀️ Imagination, on the other hand, is like having a wild and creative mind. It's like being able to dream up all sorts of crazy and amazing things that don't exist in real life. 🌟

But here's the thing: while imagination is cool and all, knowledge is way more important in the real world. Think about it! Without knowledge, you wouldn't be able to do things like build a house, grow food, or even fix a broken toy. 🛠️ You need knowledge to survive and thrive in the real world. 🌟

For example, take the COVID-19 pandemic. Without the knowledge and information about the virus, we wouldn't have been able to develop vaccines or treatments to help stop it. 💉 And without the knowledge of how to properly wear masks and social distance, we wouldn't have been able to slow the spread of the virus. 🚫

Another example is in science and technology. Scientists and inventors need knowledge of the world around them to create new things and solve problems. 🔬 Without knowledge of physics, chemistry, and other sciences, we wouldn't have things like computers, smartphones, or even electricity! 💻💡

So, while imagination is definitely important for creativity and inspiration, knowledge is way more important for survival and success in the real world. 🌟💡 So, the next time you're brainstorming ideas or solving a problem, remember: knowledge is power!";1
"Dear Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I think in order to help people in community service we should take the time to help people that are in need of help. This would be a great thing to do because it would be helping people. Helping people is a awesome way in showing how much people care about other people.

For an example; if we were to be require to take community service at school, some students would be need of help in math, language arts, science, social studies or anything that a student would need help in and would be able to receive help. This would make our learning increase and more student would be going to college. Parents, teachers, and even students want the best for themselves and with a help that each student could get it would make students comprehend and understand what the concept or subject they are working with. It will also make teaching easier.

Having community service will make students want to be focused in doing good things such as helping students or people and doing things that won't lead them to bad things. Community service will also help the community in having good and safe home and nice people around them. That's why i believe the principle should require community service to each student.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME";0
"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students don't have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house.

A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school.

This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school.

In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher won't let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school.

The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.";0
"I disagree with the principle's policy to make it so that you need at least a B average in each class.

My reasons are that GPA is more important than your overall performance in each class, activities help kids socially, and not letting kids play on a team would hurt the kid's future and the school's reputation.

First off, I think that being able to do after school activities should be judged on GPA instead.

A student shouldn't be punished for not excelling in one particular subject.

Someone could get one C in a class and in the other classes do well.

For example, a student could have all A's except for one C and he would still have a GPA of above a 3.5.

In this particular situation, the student would have a passing GPA and he deserves to be able to do after school activities.

Next, students with poor grades deserve not to be an outcast or an anti-social kid.

The kids already are struggling to keep up their grades and not being able to socialize and make friends at an activity will make that problem occur.

For example, if a student didn't get along with the people in his academic classes, then he could join an after-school activity or sport of his liking where he could meet people who share the same interests as him.

Also, it is thought that after-school activities are a good way to get better grades.

My last reason is that not letting a person do an after school activity or sport would actually hurt the school in some ways and actually make the kid's future even worse.

In an athlete's situation, not allowing him to play of the high school's team would make it so they don't learn how to play with a team or to improve at a good rate.

Also, the schools sports teams might be hurt as well if their best player has a grade average of under a B.

In conclusion, you should be able to have a grade average of below or above a B to be able to participate in after-school activities.";0
"People use their cell phones for just about everything. Citizens on the daily, use their phones for GPS, texting, calling, social media, etc.. There are pros and cons to using cell phones while driving, also depending how you use them. But if I had to choose in between the two, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle unless there's an emergency, and here's why.

Accidents happen every day and it is very rare at times, that people make it out alive. People are dying almost every day from car accidents because of cell phones. About 30 percent of accidents involve talking, texting on cell phones. That should send a message to people saying, "" Hey, stop texting and driving"". When you decide to use your phone and drive, you've basically just decided to put not just you, but someone else's life at risk.

Take consideration in your passengers, pedestrians, and other people's operating a vehicle life. It does not take long to pull over or park your car to take care of whatever was so important that u had to put other lives in danger and pull your cell phone out. You need to really think about what's really important when your want to pull your phone out. And let's not just skip over the fact that is illegal. Being pulled over or caught on your phone while driving can affect you, negatively.

With driving and using your phone being against the law, if you are caught, you will get an automatic fixed penalty notice, three penalty points, and a fine. And if your license gets suspended and you continue to drive, it's an additional 6 months. So slow down and really ask yourself is this worth picking up the phone right away to text your boyfriend/girlfriend back. Is this really this time to call friends and make plans? I would say it's a lot to think about but it's not. Just do the right thing.

Imagine not making it back home to your loved ones. Imagine what you could cause and put other people through that they didn't deserve, because they were doing the right thing. Or put yourself in their shoes. Just think about it before you decide to pull your phone out and possibly cause accidents maybe death. We can prevent things happening like that if we just do the right thing. Is the cell phone worth it? That's a decision for you to make. But I would tell you, "" No, we as drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle"".    ";0
"Having a positive attitude in life has a plethora of benefits. It’s often said that a positive outlook on life is half the battle, and it can be incredibly important for success. With a positive attitude, job opportunities can be more easily obtained. Employers often prefer those with a strong, positive disposition, and a negative attitude can be detrimental when interviewing for a job. In addition, a positive attitude can be immensely helpful when making decisions. Being confident in one’s decisions and having a clear perspective can be important when working towards a desired goal. A positive attitude can also be beneficial when facing difficult life situations. It can give strength to endure through hardships and peace of mind to not be overcome by stress and anxiety.

While some may argue that one’s Intelligence and hard work is more than enough for success, it shouldn’t be overlooked that often a positive attitude is necessary for success. In many cases, hard work and a sound attitude can be beneficial together. The two can come together to create an effective strategy where both can complement each other and contribute greatly to an individual’s success. Therefore, it may be argued that a positive attitude in life is just as important as one’s intelligence and hard work.";1
"Being part of a strong, productive team can offer a range of advantages and create an atmosphere of mutual support, making tasks much more enjoyable. Working in a group brings us the opportunity to brainstorm, collaborate, and learn from each other’s knowledge and expertise. It also encourages us to be proactive and enhances the productivity of the entire team. 

I can certainly vouch for this. During my years in college, I worked on many projects in small teams, and each time I'd take away some new insight or valuable knowledge. Working with others also provided an atmosphere of accountability where members could help each other stay on track and work out problems together.

Outside sources can also provide evidence for the benefits of working in groups. According to a study by Fordham University’s Center for Teaching Excellence, “When a student works in a group, they can often come up with insights, questions, and explanations that they might not have thought of on their own. In addition, peers can challenge and motivate each other which can lead to higher-quality work.” It is clear, then, that group work can be an incredibly effective and important learning experience for all parties involved.";1
"The Callenge of Exploring Venus

Venus is the second planet from are sun . Venus is like earth twin it's the closest planet to Earth . Venus has been a challenging place to examine more closely . People have tried to study venus since t's so close but it has not always worked out.

So we have Earth , Venus , and Mars . those all have differeces in speed meaning that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times Venus . since Venus sometimes s right around the corner .humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the planet . every previous mission was unmanned , no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. This is why no spaceship has touched on Venus in more than three decades . This made it hard for humans to study .

Venus has temperatures of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit the atmospheric pressure is 90 times higher then what we experience on are own planet. These conditions are extreme . in the story it say's that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any plant in our solar system, the wearther erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface . That's why when we tried to land on Venus are craft got distroded .

Venus used to be like earth but mostly not anymore . since Venus is like what its like we can't take samples from rocks,gas etc. we would have to dig deeper into are work so we can find out why Venus is the way it is. Its good that they are working to better are craft to find out more about Venus .NASA is working on something that's seem like it would work well for Venus .

Venus is worthy of studying despite the dangers because if we stop we will never know what it's really like why it does the things it does . If we keep trying we will have the best craft and it will work . I know everybody wants to know if we can have life on a planet and Venus might just be the one . although Venus made it hard for humans to study it also gave them light weight on how to make the craft better and to know that it is dangrous so they know now that they need better craft.

"The electoral college is a process where electors are sent to choose who the next president will be. Electors usually vote for who they said they were going to but can change this vote. I think we shouldn't have the electoral college anymore because, The people don't get to actually choose who they want to elect and voters can change who they're going to vote for.

The people who are voting for their president they wanted elected arn't actually voting for him. In source two, it says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" This means that even if the president gets the popular vote, it doesn't mean he will always win. Electors can and will avoid the states that they know are not going to vote for the person they want to win the elections, and will avoid those states. In source two, it says ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canididates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" Sometimes the voters don't even get to see the electors they're voting for and some states don't get them at all. The electors also purposley avoid certain states because they know that they won't vote for them or give them a chance to swing the election.

Voters can also change who they're voting for on the spot and no one can say or do anything about. In source two, it says ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" People voting for who the wanted to win the election could be accidently voting for someone else because of the electors work. The elector shouldn't be allowed to change his vote, because that is cheating people out of who they think should win and making it seem like their vote didn't even matter. Some states also have more electors than others, making it so that the person one state votes for will get more votes than the other states.

Some people think that electoral college system should still be there. Source 3 says, ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" Even if the electors that are selected and its said that the trust is rarely betrayed, the electors can still betray the person they're voting for and it can happen and it has happened before. It also doesn't say anything about the electors avoiding states that they know won't vote for them and going to states that can swing the election.

In conclusion, people don't get to vote for who they want to and electors can do basically whatever they have to do to win. People vote for the president they want to win and can be cheated out of that by the electors. The electors are allowed to move from a state they think won't vote for them to one they think will. The electors can also change who they're voting for during the elections. The electoral college is a system that cheats voters out of who they want to vote for and seems like a outdated and non-democratic method.    ";0
"I truthfully believe this is not created by aliens. Even if the artifact was created by aliens we have no proof of actually seeing them. NASA denies that there is not any other logical proof of aliens, but NASA's budget really wishes there was an ancient civilization. It would mean great publicity and further exploration into science. As a scientist learning about this you may believe anything within earshot. Whatever could seem logical, could not really be what is really right. Confusing as this argument sounds, I really believe that aliens never would have made this artifact. Could something like this happen? Do they really exsist?

Nature is different on mars, how is this effective? Mars has different climates and weather storms that we don't experience on earth. Maybe, the ""face"" is a weathered rock and when shadows cross over it it really looks like a face. Does that seem truthful enough to you? Or even believable? Sometimes when we look at clouds they can be different shapes as what we think they look like. To you, this is artifact that needs further examination. If we could excavate it from Mars we could further our studies on what truly made this rock really look like a face. How could this happen, you may ask? The cost of getting another spaceship to Mars and having a crew does cost alot of money, I understand. NASA made the last possible missions come true, would we be putting the people in that spaceship in danger?

Mars really isn't that safe, that may be why people dont life on Mars without a suit and oxygen tank. Because something bad could really happen up there, and we need contact with earth to tell whats going on. That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens. The face on Mars is an icon for magazines and movies like ""The Martian"" and books like ""The Lunar Chronicles"". A single dicovered thing can turn sellers into money-makers easliy. All these fanatsy in books and movies, really can make us believe what we believe.

Pictures say that shadows make it look like a face. To me the artifact looks like a giant rock, with holes in it. When the shadows of clouds do come along it looks like a face. We may reallly never know who, what, or how this confusing landmark was made. The whole solar system moves around the sun, sometimes they said that they couldnt find Cydonia. Its stuck behind the cloud storms, but this face is really a natural landform on Mars. Now pictures can be photoshopped can't they? If this really was a face why does it look the way it does? From early pictures they turned out blurry and you cant really see the face. I still dont see the face.

Some say the camera doesnt lie, well in this case it may. If aliens were there making these faces wouldnt there be more? it would be a culture to them, or a ceremonial thing. We may never know. All these questions have no answer to them. What is really happening on Mars? Why were the artifacts made, but its really something we will never understand.

If aliens did make the artifact where are they? Wouldnt we see something about them or some weird signals coming from them? Aliens dont really exsist, as much as the subject wraps around our brains, it really leaves us clueless on what we know and what we dont know. Since we really have no proof, I believe that aliens did not make this artifact, found on Mars. I could be wrong to some people, but i believe my claim is true. There really may be a civilization on Mars if we could really think about it and further our studies. But for now i believe this artifact is really just a weathered rock on the face of Mars. ";0

In 1945, World War II had ended in Europe.

Many contries were ruined.

UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys.

UNRRA hired them to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

In August 1945, they had gotten orders to go to New Orleans.

That day they arrived, the Pacific War had ended.

In 1947, Luke had gone on nine trips, the most a Seagoing Cowboy has been on.

It took him about to weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States.

It also took a month to get to China. When he cared for animals during the crossings it kept him busy on the trips.

Alough the sea can be dangerous, he liked it.

On Luke's second trip, he was a watchman.

He had to keep eyes on all the animals every hour.

On a rainy night, he acidently slide down a slippery ladder on his back.

He got super scared, his heart raced.

He shot down a slide, feet first.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped the slide, keeping him from flying overboard.

He had an injury, he had cracked ribs.

When the boys had free time they had fun.

They played volleyball and baseball. They also liked to play table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. They also read.

They helped pass the time when he nothing to do.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can open up a whole new world to you.

It makes you more aware of people's needs.

That is what it is like to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Do you become a Seagoing Cowboy now?

You should, it could be really fun.

"When people ask for advise, they usually don't know what path or choice to make.

When people make a wrong desition they can mess something up in their life. That can mean the world to them like a wife/husban or his/her kids. They can set a bad influence on small kids by going to jail or by doing something a criminal might do. That is why most people go to jail and don't come out for a very long long time. That sucks to not see your mom/dad for a very long time and that can be depressing on some people.

Then if they make a good choice they won't get in trouble or get in federal trouble. that can make a good influence on your childeren and that can give them a better futer in this world. If you talk to the right person that gives you good advise. That can be a very good choice for you and your family because they won't have to see you in jail through a little window.

Just what im saying is if you mess up by talking to the wrong person you can set a bad influence on people, more family and that would suck to see your chidren and wife through a little window in a prison trust me I have been through it all. if you get in bad trouble you can probubly fix it and just get a ticket, fin, or mistimener you can fix it dont make the wrong choice and get in trouble do what you think is the best for you and your family. Don't think bout other just worry bout you and your family not anybody else

Also if you do they can take your stuff, steal money, stab you in the back and also become an turn on you, a freind is a doller in your pocket and your pocket gots a hole my mom says that to me a lot. Just do what your heart says not other people because the can get you in a lot of trouble.

"Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the job position at your esteemed organization. As an 8th-grade student, I am eager to demonstrate my skills and potential to contribute to your team.

Firstly, I have a proven track record of working well with people. In my previous roles, I have always been able to build strong relationships with my colleagues, clients, and customers. For example, during my summer job at the local ice cream shop, I was responsible for managing the cash register and interacting with customers. I always made sure to greet them with a smile and provide excellent customer service, earning me many positive reviews and repeat business. Additionally, I have always been able to collaborate effectively with my team members, whether it be through group projects or working together to complete tasks at my previous job.

Secondly, I am willing to work extra hours to ensure that the job is done to the best of my ability. I understand that sometimes unexpected events may arise, and I am always willing to step up and help out when needed. For instance, during my internship at the local library, I was responsible for organizing and restocking the shelves. On one occasion, the librarian called in sick, and I was tasked with managing the entire library by myself. I was initially overwhelmed, but I took the initiative to prioritize my tasks and make sure that everything was running smoothly. I even stayed an extra hour to finish up some tasks that needed to be completed before closing.

Lastly, I am a hard worker who is dedicated to achieving my goals. I have always been a self-motivated individual who takes pride in my work. For example, during my time at my previous job, I was tasked with creating a new marketing campaign to increase sales. I spent countless hours researching and brainstorming ideas, and eventually, I came up with a successful campaign that exceeded our sales goals. Additionally, I have always been willing to take on new challenges and learn new skills, whether it be through attending workshops or taking online courses.

In conclusion, I believe that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this job position. I am confident that I can contribute to your team and help achieve your goals. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

"The ability for students to attend classes remotely via online video conferencing can be both beneficial and detrimental. Learning from home allows students to study and work simultaneously in an environment they are familiar and comfortable with, and eliminates the need to commute, potentially saving them time and money. On the other hand, there are potential distractions that can arise, such as family members or pets in the home, or students choosing to opt out of class and instead spend the time on their own activities. Additionally, it can be more difficult to connect with the teacher and receive help from them, as limited guidance and direct feedback may be provided from a distance. 

Ultimately, while there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with attending classes remotely, it is essential to consider each situation on an individual basis. Ultimately, with the right mindset and dedication, remote learning can be a powerful tool for students, allowing them to master new skills and apply them to real life situations.";1
"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens and we know this because if there was life on Mars we would have seen more evidence of it then just the Face, and there are many Martian mesas in the area where we found the Face so it is most likely to be another mesa with shadows that make it look like a human face. Like the many types of different natural landmarks we have on Earth.

We have taken more pictures of the Face on Mars that don't show any evidence of alien life on Mars. The most recent being the one we took on April 8, 2001 on a camera that takes pictures with better resolution that helps us see more then just the Face but also anything else that could be around the Face, like, pyramids, airplanes, and small shacks. The picture showed something that looked more like the landforms that are common here around the American West. And the picture was take on a cloudless day in Cydonia so it is more clearly seen in the photo.

The Face on Mars is just another landmark like the ones we have on Earth and was not created by aliens because we have more evidence that proves so. Like how if there was alien life on Mars we would have to have seen something that shows that anything could be living there on Mars. The Face on Mars looks more like it has shadows that have made it have the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.";0
"Curfews are a common way for parents to ensure that their teenagers are safe and responsible. However, many teenagers struggle to abide by these rules, which can have serious consequences. In this essay, I will investigate the potential consequences of disobeying a curfew set for teenagers during the week and weekends, research the legal requirements and penalties for breaking curfew, and explore potential alternative methods of discipline.

One of the most significant consequences of disobeying a curfew is the potential for legal consequences. In many states, breaking curfew is considered a misdemeanor, which can result in fines, community service, or even jail time. Additionally, if a teenager is caught breaking curfew multiple times, they may face more severe penalties, such as a suspended driver's license or even expulsion from school.

Another potential consequence of disobeying a curfew is the impact on a teenager's academic performance. Teenagers who consistently break curfew may struggle to attend school regularly, which can lead to missed assignments and lower grades. Furthermore, if a teenager is caught breaking curfew while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they may face additional academic consequences, such as suspension or expulsion.

In addition to legal and academic consequences, disobeying a curfew can also have social consequences. Teenagers who consistently break curfew may be seen as irresponsible and unreliable by their peers, which can damage their reputation and relationships. Furthermore, if a teenager is caught breaking curfew while engaging in risky behavior, such as vandalism or theft, they may face social consequences, such as being ostracized from their peer group.

Given the potential consequences of disobeying a curfew, it is essential for parents to explore alternative methods of discipline. One effective method is to have open and honest communication with their teenagers about the importance of curfews and the potential consequences of breaking them. Parents can also explore alternative methods of discipline, such as grounding or limiting privileges, that are tailored to their teenager's specific needs and interests.

In conclusion, disobeying a curfew set for teenagers during the week and weekends can have serious consequences, including legal, academic, and social consequences. It";1
"Dear [Police Department],

I am an 8th grade student who is interested in pursuing a career in law enforcement. I have been researching different careers in the police force and have come to the conclusion that it is the career that I am most passionate about.

One of the reasons why I am interested in the police force is because of the important role that they play in maintaining public safety. Police officers are responsible for protecting the community and ensuring that the law is upheld. They put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe and I find that to be incredibly brave and admirable.

In addition to my research, I have also been attending criminology classes to learn more about the field. These classes have taught me about the different types of crimes that exist, the ways in which they are investigated, and the different strategies that law enforcement agencies use to prevent them. I find this information to be fascinating and I am eager to learn more.

I would like to express my interest in visiting your police force to learn more about the day-to-day operations and to gain a better understanding of the role that police officers play in the community. I believe that this would be a valuable experience for me and would help me to make an informed decision about my future career.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the opportunity to learn more about the police force and to meet with some of your officers.

Sincerely,

"Have you ever wondered ""what if making students do at least one extracurricular could help them improve in school""? I know many people who have thought about that and truth be told, they are right. I agree with the principle that students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Doing this can help students do better in school, get better at playing any sports that they are interested in, and can help relive students who are stressed out from school or home.

do have a students who is struggling in school due to lack of knowledge and understatement? Staying after school for an educational extracurricular can and will help students do better in school. I have taken a language and struggled to understand and comprehend it, but at my school they provide us with after school clubs that are also extracurricular's. So one day I decided to stay after for a french extracurricular that I ended up really enjoying, so I started to go every day that it was offered, I started realized how much of an impact it made on my grade I went from having a C to an A. This is one of the many impacts an educational extracurricular activity can have of your students.

Have you ever been really interested in a sport but not knowing how to play it?

If you think about it, Labron James was not always as amazing of a basketball player as he is now. The reason he is so good is because of how much time, effort and motivation he put into his practices. Staying after for a sport can put you on your path to being able to succeed to doing well at the sport. That is why it is so important to have after school sport extracurricular activities to help students who have a dream of playing the sport professionally accomplish it.

Students who feel more stressed out from school or home are less likely to do as well in school as others. Students who have parents who make them do homework as soon as they get home without a break feel more stressed, and probably wont put in as much effort as they would is they got a break. At my school they provide us with after school downtime clubs to help students relive their mind. It also helps students get the break that is needed form a hard working day at school, and students are more likely to have better grade outcomes.

This is why is it good for students to be required to do at least on extracurricular activity after school. They will help students do better in school, help students who are interested in playing any sports get better, and will help students who are stressed from school feel more relived. So next time you doubt what amazing powers of extracurricular activities remember how much of great of an effect it can have on students.     ";0
"Generic_Name closes his eyes as the teacher thunders her way towards him. She finally arrives with a hungry smile and cruel eyes and says,""Generic_Name did you do your homework?"".""No i did not teacher because I had no time due to the outrageous rule that the principal made that made it mandatory that all students participate in one extracurricular activity."" Her eyes gleamed with anticipation as she gave Generic_Name an F and walked off to seek her next victim. The rule that dictates that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity is a mutiny and should be abolished at once because,students can use the extra time for more beneficial uses such as doing their homework or catching up on some sleep,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.

The first reason why the rule that states that you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be nullified is,that students can use the extra time for more productive purposes such as doing homework or catching up on some sleep. When i was younger I used to participate in writing club and when I would come back home I would be drained. I would have no energy to do anything so the majority of the time my assignments went incomplete and turned into zeros. One day the teachers started noticing the lack of turned in assignments and called my parents for a parent teacher conference. the teachers brought me and my parents to a table wearing serious expressions. The teacher said,""Your son has displayed superior thinking skills but the lack of turned in assignments astounds us."" My parents replied by saying,""Our son gets back everyday from writing club extremely tired and does not have the time or energy to do his homework."" they came to a conclusion to cancel writing club for me and then I started turning in my homework on time. 44 percent of homework is not completed due to lack of time. If you say that they can do their homework when they get home after the extracurricular activity I would say that kids are not fully developed adults yet and dont have as much energy or stamina and cannot function after long periods of time.

The second reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be abolished is,that schools do not specialize in what club or sport that they offer and they will not teach it as well as the facilities that specialize in what they are offering. Its not the schools job to provide extra clubs they can offer clubs but they should not be able to force you to join a club. If a child wants to play a sport or endorse an activity, he can go to an outdoor club or facility that specializes in what the child wants to do. When i was eleven years old,I played on my school soccer team. The coach did not know how to play soccer and I hated it. I never got any better and I almost quit soccer then and there,but I went home one night and told my mom about it. She said,""You should try UCLA Soccer I read about it it's very interesting"". I tried it out the very following week it was amazing,I loved it and,I have been playing soccer ever since. If you say that the school clubs can also be good at teaching what they do I would tell you that a school club will never be as good at teaching a sport or activity than an actual facility that specializes at the given sport or activity.

The third and final reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activities must be abolished is,that if you force the kids to choose from a limited set of sports and clubs they might not like any of the activities that you are offering and because of that they will never practice what they are being taught and will never get better at what they are being taught. If a person does not like what they are being taught 98 percent of the people will not practice the subject or sport they do not like. If you dont practice what you are being taught you will never get better at what you are practicing and will never succeed at it. My cousin used to play karate and he hated it he would always pass the tests but he would never practice and as a black belt some of the blue belts that practiced were stronger than him. One day his mom asked him""Why arent you as good as some of the other students""? He replied by saying,""I dont enjoy karate like I used to and as a result,I don't practice anymore"".

If you say that people at school can like the subject or sport they are being taught I would say that is the reason extracurricular activities should be offered but not forced.

Generic_Name smiles at the teacher as she comes by ""Do you have your homework she asks""?""Yes ma am.""he replies with a grin. Ever since the rule that made extracurricular activities mandatory got abolished he has had time to finish all of his assignments and still had a little time for relaxation. I disagree with the principal's rule that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity because students can use the time for more beneficial purposes,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.";0
"The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" Program.

Luke's participation in the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program allows him to experience adventures and visit many unique places. I think many of you should join this program. Here are my reasons why you should join this program: you can save someone,you get a nice experience by traveling to different countries, and when your done doing your job you can hangout with the other cowboys.

My first reason is that you can save someone. You can save a life since the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program is all about taking care of horses,young cows, and mules ,and shipping them overseas to other countries to help people out. Luke knew if he signed up he can help rescue people in trouble. Think about it for a second. You can also help save someone who has suffered because of the war.

My second reason is that you can get a unique experience. Have you ever wanted to travel to China or Europe? Well you can if you join this program since the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program travels to many places to ship animals. Luke got to experience China,Europe, but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to him. Luke also taked a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. You can get a one of a kind experience from this.

My third reason is that when you are done with your job you can just relax. Also you can go play with the other cowboys sports in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Luke had found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. It is not all about doing work there is some fun in it too.

In conclusion, these are my reasons on why you should join this program. You can get a good experience if you join this program. Bieng a Seagoing Copwboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world for him. ""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" he says. That awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students, and exchange visitors for many years. I hope my essay has persuaded you to join this program.";0
"Even after proven wrong, people are still thinking that the face on mars is an actual alien made face. In paragraph 10 it staes that on April 5th 1998 a global surveyor flew over Cydonia with a camera 10 times sharper than the photo taken in the original 1976 picture, shown to prove that on this picture the closer up it looks less like a face. But this wasn't the end of the research.

The reaseach continues but with an even better camera to try and prove all of the conspiracy believing people wrong. In paragraph 11 it states that the new digital image taken in 2001, was a 3 times bigger sized camera from the 1998 photo, and it was sharper than ever. This image spans over 1.56 meters! If this ""face"" was made by aliens, then why were there no artifacts found around the photograph? The extremely high def. picture would have shown said artifacts. But there are still specticals believing otherwise.

The pictures are proven to be a natural born landform, pictures don't lie. Yes, maybe if we were ON Mars we would find some new facts to maybe prove one anothers views even more, but for right now NASA is winning. Conspiracy theories are theories. Picture evidence is pure fact shown to a persons face.

Just like the belief in wether or not earth and people were made by god or science. They're both theories that's why people have to have ""faith"" in what they believe. The Big Bang theory for example is a theory because it doesn't have enough evidence to be proven that it legitimately happened. It goes the same with religion.

In conclusion, people all have thir different beliefs. Some believe that the ""face"" was alien made, some believe it's natural born. But no matter what people believe, fact is fact. What would you believe, a conspiracy (something not officially proven) or a fact with picture evidence? ";0
"To the fellow citizens, the advantages of limiting car usage in the world could limit the numbers of miles driven, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and the parks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city.

To begin informing the fellow citizens more about the advantages, the numbers of miles can be limited. In the united states the numbers of miles driven peaked  and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by doug shorts of advisor perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- 39- year-old getting a licenses. Driven was found that young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. All according to source 4:The end of car culture.

To continue the advantages, passenger cars are responisble for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissons in Europe. Beijing and china are well known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. In the suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes makes a huge impediment to current efforts to drasticallyreduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, experts says. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emisson.

"The subject of requiring students to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities has caused significant debate among educators, students, and other stakeholders. In one camp, it is argued that requiring students to maintain a certain academic standard helps to reward hard work in the classroom and also encourages them to take their studies seriously as opposed to being a distraction from their academic pursuits. On the other side, however, some have raised the point that this policy could unfairly limit the opportunities of some students who may excel in activities such as sports or the arts but lack the academic skills needed to maintain a B average. 

My position is that requiring a B average to participate in school activities is an unfair policy that can heavily impact students who are struggling with their school work and put a financial burden on families who already struggle to afford extracurricular activities. A policy such as this can ultimately have the opposite intended effect, as it may serve to discourage low-income students and other minorities from participating in activities due to the additional difficulty in meeting the required average. Furthermore, it could potentially lead to alienation among students who are unable to meet the academic requirements, which would further impact their engagement in school activities. 

While the intention of requiring a B average is to ensure students have a strong academic foundation, the potential consequences and disadvantages of such a policy suggest that it is not an effective solution for achieving this goal. Rather, it is important to provide support and mentorship for struggling students to ensure they receive the education and resources they need to succeed.";1
"Have you ever thought of asking more than one person for advice? There are multiple reasons why you should. You should always talk to a smarter person because they can know more facts. You can see of different people have the same opinion as you. Someone could be wrong and you could have asked the wrong person and given you false information. You should get more opinions because it's smart to have more and you can't just rely on one opinion it can totally wrong.

My first reason is that you should ask the smarter person because they know more. You can't go up to a random dude on the street and ask him about your college work he might know nothing about it. You should go to your professor and ask him or her how should I go with this and how would it make me better at it. In sports you shouldn't go to basketball coach and ask him how to go when swimming a 100 freestyle he wouldn't know how to. This goes with my second reason that you can get false information like asking a random person again what is 5 to the second power and he could say 10 but if u ask a teacher it is actually 25.

The third reason is that always get other peoples opinion like if you are asking how to deal with a newborn you can ask a family member who has already had a kid before and ask how they took care of it. Doctors are a great use of asking that kind of information and using real websites that are approved by real doctors and specialist. Another good reason is to get more than one opinion because you cant just think one pearson is right they could have a good way but always ask someone else to see if they have the same opinion as you. I personally think you should multiple people because it would like to get more and different ways on how to do something. It lets me have different ways so that if I don't like one of the ways someone tells me to do I can have different ones and see if I like them.

So in conclusion you should always ask different people for advice not just one. Because you can get false information. You can't rely on one pearson and see if people have the same opinion as you. Always find the smarter pearson to talk to not some random weird guy of the street who says he knows everything. These are some good reasons to why you should always ask other people for their opinion for advice.";0
"Car accidents are increasing due to the use of cell phones. People often stare at their cell phones while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. Hundreds-of-thousands of lives were lost because of car accidents. Although the death rates are increasing, drivers today are still texting while driving. The use of cell phones while driving should not be allowed, or death rates will keep rising.

Cell phones were created to stay in contact from far away people, but only to be used as a distraction from reality. People often use their cell phones while doing important activities, driving is one of them. Using cell phones while on the road causes the drivers attention all on the phone, rather than in front of them. Plenty of lives were taken non-stop due to these incidents. Whether the driver flipped in their cars, crashed, or hitting somebody taking their lives instead.

Vehicles was supposed to make lives easier with transportation, and create a better society. Instead vehicles were used to kill others, or make people suffer. Vehicles increased the use of cell phones at an alarming rate. Soon after that, getting in car accidents were a common thing. Lives were fragile in the hands of drivers, and they shattered it.

Within the state of Georgia on 2018, a law has been passed to no longer drive with phone in hand or get a ticket. The risk of accidents is to high to have drivers behind the wheel with a phone in their hands. Both eyes should be on the road if they are behind the wheels, or receive a ticket or lose a life. Accidents has been occurring less due to the new law in Georgia. Phone holders or headphones/bluetooths are the only way to interact with cell phones while driving.

It takes time to show drivers cell phones are only going to cause pain and suffering behind the wheels. People should not have to walk on the side of the road worrying about cars harming them. Too many lives were taken by cars due to cell phones. We must ban together to stop driving with cell phones in their hands. All drivers must realize it's time to stop, and stay off their cell phones.                                        ";0
"A face on Mars? In 2001 there were pictures take by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft on Mars. Those pictures revealed what many believe was a face. When NASA revealed the picture for all to see they had called it ""a huge rock formation."" They stated, ""it was formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It then became a pop icon.

Some people think the Face is evience of life on Mars. Theorists say NASA was trying to hide the evidece, where defenders of the NASA budget ""wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" So, in 1998 scientists flew over Cydonia taking pictures of what many call the ""Face"" ten times sharper than before. When those pictures were released it was revealed to be a natural landform. But many argued otherwise.

For the third time in 2001, scientists went to take another look. The camera they had used proved to be much more accurate than the one used in the first Viking photo in 76. The pixels of the camera were 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel. According to scientists if there were any objects in the picture such as airplanes or Egyptian pyramids they would be able to be seen.

It is proven that the picture actaully showed butte or mesa landform. These landforms are very common around the West. The landform found was even compared to ""the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a dome about the same size size as the Face on Mars.

It is sad to say that there are proven facts that reveal there is no such thing as the ""Face on Mars"". For years scientists have been studying life on Mars. Even in 1976, 39 years ago!       ";0

"Hey, I'm super excited to write this essay about the four-day school week! I think it's a really cool idea, but I'm also a little nervous because I don't know if it would work out for my school. 🤔

So, first of all, let's talk about the advantages of a four-day school week. I think it would be really cool if we had more time to focus on our schoolwork and projects. Like, imagine having an extra day to work on that science fair project or to study for that big test! It would be so much better than cramming everything into four long days. Plus, it would be easier for us to get enough sleep, which is super important for our brains to work well. 💤

But, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Like, what if we don't get enough time to practice our sports and music stuff? I know that some schools have shorter sports seasons because of the four-day week, and that might be sad for some people. And, what if we have to work longer hours in the classroom? I don't know if I could handle being in school for ten hours a day, four days a week! It might be too much for me. 😅

I think different school environments would be affected by the four-day week in different ways. Like, some schools might be able to handle it better than others, depending on their resources and stuff. For example, schools with more money might be able to hire more teachers and staff to make sure everyone gets the support they need. But, schools with less money might have a harder time making it work. 💸

So, would this be a feasible option for my school? I'm not sure. I think it could be cool to try it out for a year and see how it goes, but I'm also worried that it might be too hard for some people. Like, what if we have to work too hard and don't have enough time for extracurricular stuff? That would be sad! 😔

In conclusion, the four-day school week is a pretty interesting idea, but it's not without its challenges. I think we should talk to our teachers and school administrators";1
"During the course of the school year, students learn and take part of the classroom life. Many take notes, create projects, listen to lectures, take tests, and more. However, by the end of the school year, teachers decide to give out summer projects. These projects can vary from reading textbooks to making a piece of artwork to assure learning during their break. There are many debates and questions about the use of summer projects. A certain question circulates around who should design the project; the teacher or the student. Teachers, however, should design these projects because they are the experts, they control the classroom, and students will put in little to no effort in making the project meaningful.

Teachers should create these projects because they are the experts of the material. Because they are well educated in the subject, they are able to create a project that is both relevant and useful to the students education. For example, my AP US History teacher is well knowledgeable about the history of the United States. Before the school year began, she assigned a project in which a student has to portray freedom in a piece of art. By doing this, she is able to connect freedom in history into a project that can create deep thought towards the subject.

Teachers also control the classroom and decide what to do for the education of their students. As a student, I am able to see the hard work put into teaching a class. My teachers have to create the lessons, teach the information, grade paperwork, and much more. However, there is also the aspect of making sure that the students are controlled enough to have the needed information get across. This goes hand in hand with the knowledge of the teacher in the subject. Due to their position of power and the expertise they acquired, teachers know what to do for the education of students. Some may say that students should design these summer projects in order to exercise freedom and creativity. However, because teachers are the experts and oversee the education of their students in their position, they know what and how to use projects for the students benefit. Both the teacher will exercise their position as a leader and student practice their creativity with the freedom these projects allow for.

Another important aspect of why teachers should create the projects is due to the lack of effort in the project if students create it. Students, after a tiring school year, want to relax during their summer break. By allowing students to design the project, they will create it in an uncaring way in order to get it over with. Students will not put the effort in both designing and finishing the project. This will create no benefit, growth, or thought in their education and academics. A personal example revolves around a project my English teacher once gave out. There was no prompt and no requirements other than a works cited. This created a hard time for students to figure out what they needed to do. As seen by this example, allowing students to design their own projects will create no benefit or direction. Without the direction of a teacher, students will not know what or how to do anything that is needed of them.

As explored in this paper, allowing students to design summer projects is not the most beneficial. This is because the teachers know the information, teachers are in charge of the classroom, and students will have no motivation to create and finish the project. As experienced in personal life and much more, too much freedom is not always for the best. ";0
if i had to choose i would change to election vote  cause it is more popular and it has less problems unlike the other  cause when you do electoral college you have to do lots ofdifferent things that is not worth doing which is a disaster for some people and while other people are saying how good the electoral college is if its so good why do you so many issues with things that happen to people thats what i dont understand they dont let some people vote cause there age which is stupid they should  let them vote thats the reason why ther areso many disputes in the world cause of the ignorance of some people and the only thing the people from electoral college is worried about iswinning instead of carring for the other people which is not right that is the reason so many outbreaks happen cause people start to not even give a crap about the people that is wanting to vote but the people is not worriedtwo cents about what anyone else thinks their just worried bout  themselves which is stupid and they should have been done something about this before it get to much out of control which is leading to much more problems it needs to come to a end and pick a president who would actually give a care about the people of the united states  instead them going around and talking about them in different ways that is not needed cause only a majority of people votes for him doesnt mean that he or she has to be a complete jerk to them and start talking bout them in bad ways that is how many fights start and when they start they dont ever stop talking bout it for a long period of time which pisses people off what if someone started talking bout you or your parents you would want to beat the crap out of them then there would be catastrophic failure which leadsto more and more drama which just makes things even worse nominees get happy that they won the vote and start getting all crazy and start saying things just to get people all ticked off and things that really didnt meanto happen happens to people that did not even do anything to hurt that person at all which is messed up cause they dont give no effort to even say they are sorry for what they did to that person the advocates that are in the position they say things that make arguements and other things that dont need to happen begin which doesnt make things any easier it just causes more drama that doesnt need to happen cause even more trouble that is not a good thing to have happen when that happens it just has bad things happening everywhere and it only makes things worse which leads to cause even more drama in peoples life and it doesnt seem fun getting out of all that drama that happened    ;0
"Hey there!  So, I know some people might think that having a curfew for teenagers is like, super lame, but hear me out. I think it could actually be pretty beneficial.

First of all, let's talk about safety. Like, have you seen the news lately? There are creeps out there who are just waiting to prey on innocent teens. A curfew would give parents peace of mind knowing that their kids are safe at home instead of wandering around alone at night. And let's be real, teens can be kind of clueless sometimes.  I mean, I know I definitely wouldn't be able to navigate a dark alley without getting into trouble. 

But it's not just about safety. A curfew could also help teens develop responsibility. I mean, think about it. If we had to be home at a certain time every night, we'd have to learn how to manage our time better and make sure we're doing our homework and chores on time. Plus, it would teach us how to be more accountable for our actions. Like, if we know we have to be home by 10 PM, we're less likely to be out causing trouble or getting into trouble. 

And let's not forget about the whole ""teenagers are rebellious"" thing.  A curfew could actually be a good way to channel that rebellious energy into something productive. Instead of sneaking out to go to parties or hang out with friends, we could be using that time to work on our passions or pursue our interests. Like, I know I'm really into photography, and if I had a curfew, I could use that time to edit my photos or learn new techniques.

Of course, there are some downsides to a curfew. Like, it could be super inconvenient for us teens who have after-school activities or jobs. And some people might feel like it's a violation of their freedom. But I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Plus, it's not like we're going to be stuck at home all the time. We could still";1
"Focus On The Road

Do you think you should be on your device while driving a vehicle? It's very dangerous and most people don't even think about it. Most people get distracted because of social media or to even text a friend. Electronic devices today are a big distraction in today's world causing lack of communication, lack of exercising and a lot of problems. Teenagers have the most accidents while driving because they're either on the phone or talking to someone. You should use the phone when you arrive at your destination. Until then focus on the road.

While being on the road you should be able to focus on your location and other cars around you. You shouldn't let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the road. Traffic goes on a lot and you shouldn't worry about picking up a phone. Texting on the phone while driving can cause you to react more slowly than you expect. Some people may think there are professionals at multitasking but it's wrong. Try to avoid distractions so you can be safe.

It is bad to use your phone while driving because it is dangerous. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing videos, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. Crashes are increasing every year because of distracted driving. Distracted driving is one of the biggest and most common reasons. It's caused by any activity that takes your attention off the road. The only time you should use your phone is when you need help going somewhere. If you need help getting around you can use your GPS on your phone. Before you get in the car you should set up your GPS and put it in a spot you can keep glazing at. You should also use a bluetooth device to help you communicate. Also if something happens to you pull over and call Someone.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It's best to stay safe at all times while driving. Focus on the road until you reach your destination and always avoid distractions. Without cell phone distractions the rate of car crashes will decrease. So do you think you should be on your device while driving?   ";0
"Despite the risks that Venus poses, the extreme planet is very intimidating in terms of exploration and data collection. In the passage, the author supports the idea well by backing up his claim with real situations that have been close to discovering the climate, geography and other data about this unknown planet. Without being able to know a lot about Venus, the author can make supported claims with the information that has been found about the planet up to this point.

Throughout the article, the author gives certain statistics about Venus and the extremities of the planet. Along with giving the data, the author also seems to ask the reader what the point of exploring Venus even is. With that, he then explains why, even through the harsh conditions, scientists continue to study the planet. He then gives examples of new ways that have been found to study the different things about Venus; showing the reader that he is supporting his claim as to how the planet could be studied even with the extremities of the climate and geography.

While giving different statistics and data, the author raps the article up by saying that the travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts and should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. With this being said, the reader can clearly see that the author is still supporting his claim with the exception of the technology being absent to conduct studies that could land human exploration on another planet.

"Phones & Driving

People should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous and illegal to text while driving. Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use cell phones while driving. People who use cell phones while driving are putting themselves and other people in danger; therefore, they are likely to get hurt. Drivers that are distracted by cellphones are likely to not pay attention to the road or be aware what is happening on the road. Three reasons people should not use their phones while driving is that they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions. People can easily get distracted by being on the phone with someone while driving. Some distractions are interruptions and entertainment by engaging in talking to someone outside your car and not paying attention to the other people or vehicles around you. Drivers should always pay attention to the road, because it is uncertain what might happen particularly, if the driver is not being careful while driving. In this case, they are more likely to have a crash.

Another reason people should not use their phones while driving, is because accidents happen when drivers do not focus on their surrounding. Operating a phone while driving is equal to; talking to people in your vehicle, or tampering with the radio instead of paying attention to the road, in regards to driving hazards. Some drivers that use cell phones while driving, cause accidents; therefore, they end up have to face serious consequences.

Finally, drivers should not use phones while driving because it can cause injuries. People can suffer pain and be all bruised up, because of the irresponsible driver not paying attention to the road. In addition, some injuries sustained as a result of cellphone use while driving, results in death. Some injuries due to the use of cellphones while driving can cause victims to have internal bleeding, skull fractures, or head, brain, neck, back injuries, and so on. In order to prevent injuries, the driver of the car should turn their phone off at all times while driving. When the driver gets to their destination, then they can resume using their phones. People should only use their phone before or after driving.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries. Cellphones use while driving can greatly increase the risk of having an accident. Drivers that drive while not paying attention, are putting others' lives at risk and that is selfish. While driving, people should look out for signs and other things like animals and people. If someone calls the driver, then the driver can ask the person beside them to answer it.

Eliminating cellphones is the best way to save people lives.            ";0
"The sound of everyone coughing not because they're sick, but because the air around them is tainted. Car use should be decreased because eventually, every city will look like Beijing, China does now, or worse, and carbon dioxide emissions rip apart the Ozone Layer.

There is a reason people in Beijing wear gas masks. This city is one of the most polluted cities in the world, according to Robert Duffer in

Paris Bans Driving due to Smog . Pollution causes humans to develop tumors, become brain-dead, have strokes and heart attacks, and many more horrible diseases. Do you really want to have babies, just born, dying because the pollution is too much for their tiny lungs? America is slowly becoming a hive for pollutants. If this keeps up, It'll be unlivable, like Chernobyl or Nagasaki.

Carbon dioxide is slowly ripping apart our atmosphere. If this bad habit of ours stays, Earth will become the next Mars. Nothing would survive on its surface. Do you really want humanity to be the extinction of millions of species of animals and plants, including ourselves? Ozone is what protects the Earth from the Sun's harsh ultraviolet light, and that protective layer of our atmosphere is being drained away. If something as small as Paris, France, which ""

Typically has more smog than other European capitals ,"" (

Paris Bans Driving due to Smog , by Robert Duffer.)can cause so many problems, imagine what is happening with a country as large as America.  If our bad habit doesn't change, and soon, then there would be no more life.

In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal.) Hybrid, diesel, natural fuel, electric. None of it matters, because they all produce the same effect, and affect our atmosphere.

"In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the passage the author has put and many details supporting his idea of studuing Venus. The author uses many good details to support his idea. For example, how they came up with an idea that could keep the people safe but they wouldn'nt be able to get any sample of anything without being in to much danger. However there are still more ideas.

In this passage it says that NASA has come up with a couple ideas to explore Venus. One of their ideas was to hover a ship about 30 miles from above Venus's surface and still me able to observe from there. This supports his idea that they can still exlpore it they just wont be able to get close up and explore it better. There was also another idea that NASA came up with.

Their next idea was to send a spacecraft up but when they did it only sayed up for maybe two hours without failing. Although their first plan failed witht the spacecraft they came up with another idea for sending spacecraft back to Venus. They found a material that might be able to support the spacecraft from the heat. In order to see if this spacecraft woud work the tested it in a similator that was close to what was happening to venus and the spacecraft lasted up to three weeks in the conditions alot longer than the last one. This is another idea that supports his idea of still exploring it because they might of found a safer and better way to do it.

In the end the author of this passage has many details to support his idea of exploring Venus. They have found safer and better ways to explore Venus so why would they not do it. His idea is proven to be posible and he supports his idea very well in this passage.";0
"Have you ever wanted to trust a car with your life? I for sure have not. In the text, Google cofounder, Sergey Brin was quoted saying,""such cars would fundamentally change the world."" I disagree, driverless cars are a terrible idea for many reasons. The economy would fall tremendously. Many of people's lives would be at risk, and it's unhuman.

The economy is my biggest worry when it comes to driverless cars. Many jobs would be lost because of this. Bus drivers, taxi drivers, and factory workers jobs would be at risk. If this were to happen many families would be left homeless and hungry.

Another reason is that this could be very dangerous. I don't know about you ,but I don't want to put my life in the hands of a couple of cameras and sensors. People need to understand that commputers make mistakes and they are not perfect. The author even said,"" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless.'' This means that the driver would have to remain focused and pay attention the entire time. I think this would cause some major problems.

The driver would be texting or even sleeping at the wheel. That is definiatly not safe!

My final reason is that the driverless car is unhuman. The human race has become very lazy over the last several hundred years. Yes, we have made life much more safe and efficient ,but driverless cars is going too far. Computers and robots are already taking our people's jobs in the factories, do we really want the to take hold of our cars?

To conclude, I don't agree with this article. I believe that driverless cars would cause many problems around the world. The economy would suffer, our safety would be at risk, and the idea of driverless cars is unhuman. ";0

"I think that it wouldn't be valueable to have technology be able to read emotions because the fact that its really easy for someone else to get into your phone or tablet through face reconition. People use face reconition alot and it can be a quicker way to get into your tablets and phones or any other electronics, but people can easily crack into the electronic and take any personal infomation that they need. I mean electonic ability to read people's emotions is cool and all, and its a huge next step into newer tecnology for the future, but the fact that you know say you needed to be happy to get into your phone, some one else can act happy and, well unlock your phone.

In paragraph six the article talks about how they could make different ads show if you were happy or frowning. That could be good but if your watching, like youtube or videos and an ad shows, your going to want to keep watching your video and not the ad. If a person is watching a show and an ad pops up and they smile, then it shows another ad that the person didnt want to see because they wanted to keep watching thier show. I think people would be angry if that happen, because not a lot of people like ads. Ads can be good for promotion of products, but i think we all know when your playing a game on your electronic device that you want to keep playing or watching and not the ad.

The reasons why i said that this would be unvalueable is because the reason of security,like anything could go wrong because everything in technology can be unexpected. thats why i chose the reasons I did.";0
"Of the many planets in our solar system, Venus would be the worst to travel to. This planet is highly dangerous. The conditions are horrendous, and some people are thinking of traveling there. The cost of building a ship capable of withstanding Venus's conditions would be crazily high. The fact that the author would want to travel to, and support the idea of, Venus is outrageous. Even then, they did not support their claim too well in their article.

Venus is the second planet from the sun. Accoring to the text, the surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also, the planet has many earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and often has many lightning strikes that take down probes that wish to know the secrets of the surface. Pressure levels are also off the charts and could crush the ship anyone was travelling in.

The author of the text was not too convincing of their claim to explore Venus. The title itself does not help the claim either This planet, as said by the author, is very dangerous. Traveling to Venus and making sure conditions are suitable for people, is not very achieveable. The author seems to want to travel there and supports the idea, but they do not support their claim very much. Most of the article talks about how perilous the planet is for people to travel to. They could have supported themselves better if they talked about the benefits instead of only the dangers.

All in all, travelling to Venus would be a waste of time and money. If NASA risks the lives of people by sending them, then the trip would be for nothing. With the dangrous conditions to consider, the contemplation of whether or not to travel there is out of the question. The answer is no. It's too unsafe to put peoples' lives on the line only because scientists are curious about a dangerous planet.";0
"Yes I think that the projects should be student designed because then the student has the opportunity to learn whatever it is that they wanna learn.

personally i think that when i get to choose what i wanna learn about it makes it more intriguing to me and always has me wanting to learn more. if it is teacher designed then that means that you might have to learn about something that you really dont want to learn about. i know for a fact that when someone tells me to go and learn something its not the same as me WANTING to learn about it, i just have no drive to do the work because i feel like im getting forced to learn about something that i really dont care about. Especially during summer i dont want to learn about Robert E Lee or something because in my own opinion i think all that history stuff is the most boring stuff in the world. kids dont want to earn about that,they wanna learn how to make a video game or how to make music. nobody wants to learn about the great Gatsby or even trigonometry. we have always been told our whole life we need to graduate high school and go to a decent college to be successful in life or to even have a good job. that is not true but its what we believe because its what we were told since we could do basic math. our whole lives we are being controlled and we dont even know it. we dont ever choose what we get to learn the teachers choose it for us. i dont wanna be a historian maybe i wanna be an R&B singer or learn how to mix music maybe even create a video game. you cant do all that inside school, sure you might get a little taste of what you wanna learn but they will never teach us how to be successful in something that we are actually passionate about unless its math,science,English, or history. i honestly think its bull crap, yeah i think we should learn the basic history and basic math like algebra one something we could use in a day to day life situation. who in the world is gonna need trigonometry every single day or when is it gonna play a big part in someones life? rarely ever. and its crazy that we basically have to spend 4 years learning about things we most likely dont wanna learn about. people always say chase your dreams but how are we gonna be able to do that when we have to go to school to learns things that arent going to mean anything to us in about 10 years. ive talked to my parents they dont remember learning anything in high school. i show them my homework all the time and they just say ""what in the heck is this?"" to my math problems that im apparently going to need all my life. college is probably the most pointless thing in the world you do not need to go to college to be successful in life there are jobs in this big world that will pay you more than what a lawyer gets paid. with technology in this day and age you can become a millionaire by sitting on your butt all day and playing videos games. not even making one just playing the game. i shouldnt have to waste like 8 years of my life when i can legit be doing anything in the world but school is stopping me. i could probally be the next big thing in rapping but i dont have time to focus on it because of school. so no i dont want some stupid lame teacher picking me some boring lame topic for me to learn about i want to pick what i learn about for once. let us have some freedom. there are so many things i wanna learn about but i have to spend most of my day at school not even paying attention because they teachers never teach anything interesting. maybe if they did people who arent goody two shoes and dont get As in every single class they ever took would probally pay more attention and maybe then these black kids wont become just another statistic espically because yall make it so much harder on us african americans in school. we dont want to learn about that bull. we want to learn about cars, motorcycles stuf like that some normal boy stuff. girls dont want to learn about punctuations or how to write a dang essay. maybe they wanna start their own makeup business or something. i just dont think school is fair really. i think its a big waste of time. period. ";0
"My grandmother once told me, ""When seeking advice always get more than one opinion."" I think she told me that because, people opinions could be good for you and its probably a good idea for you to listen. Or that person thoughts could be horrible and could cost you your future as a criminal and that would lead to you being behind bars. But a positive outcome is that multiple opinions is better than one because what people think is the best idea for you is probably a good idea for you to listen. But also their ideas could be bad and good at the same time so when you apply the advice to the situation and could have a positive and negative outcome.

I personally think when getting advice always go search for it in your most trustworthy friends and family so that they can give you a good opinion. When you ask them and you receive lots of the same response it probably a good idea to listen and take their knowledge in and use it. Most importantly if you receive other information not like the other information your family and friends gave you its good to try the advice. Only to see if they give good advice or just to see if it was a better idea.

Also not all advice is good advice. Receiving advice from people that you know will lead you down a bad life or a bad lifestyle could get you into a lot of trouble or you could get hurt. When seeking advice make sure they know what they're talking about and if it doesn't seem right most likely their opinion is bad.

In conclusion, when getting advice make sure it sounds right and the person that is giving you the advice sounds correct and they will most likely be correct.";0
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that after school homework clubs are a detrimental addition to our daily routine. While some may argue that homework clubs provide a structured environment for students to complete their assignments, I believe that it takes away from family time, limits gaming opportunities, and can negatively impact a student's participation in sports.

One of the biggest drawbacks of after school homework clubs is the impact it has on family time. Many students, including myself, have busy schedules and may not have the opportunity to spend quality time with their families. By attending an after school homework club, students are required to spend additional time away from their families, which can lead to a lack of communication and a strained relationship. For example, a student who attends an after school homework club may not have the opportunity to spend time with their family during dinner, which can lead to a lack of understanding and a feeling of isolation.

Another negative impact of after school homework clubs is the limitation it places on gaming opportunities. Many students, including myself, enjoy playing video games in their free time. However, by attending an after school homework club, students are required to give up their gaming time, which can lead to a lack of enjoyment and a feeling of frustration. For example, a student who attends an after school homework club may not have the opportunity to play their favorite game with their friends after school, which can lead to a sense of disappointment and a feeling of missing out.

Finally, after school homework clubs can negatively impact a student's participation in sports. Many students, including myself, enjoy participating in sports and being part of a team. However, by attending an after school homework club, students are required to give up their sports time, which can lead to a lack of commitment and a feeling of disappointment. For example, a student who attends an after school homework club may not have the opportunity to practice their sport with their team after school, which can lead to a lack of improvement and a feeling of being left behind.

In conclusion, after school homework clubs are a detrimental addition to our daily routine. While some may argue that it provides a structured environment for students to complete their assignments, it takes away from family time, limits gaming opportunities, and can negatively impact a student's participation in sports. As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that we should be given";1
"Phones & Driving

Phones have been around for quite a while now. Half of the population uses their phones while driving. People use their phones 90% of the day to talk, text, and, answer phones calls while their behind the wheel. There are some people that knows how to use their phones and drive and then it's the ones who can't focus on the road and text. 75% of the time cell phone usage behind the wheel is used because it's an important call from the office or family emergency.

Phones was introduced in 1980 and the usage of phones have sky rocket over the last two decades. It's mostly teens who use the phone and then you have some adults who use their phone just as much as teens. Teen's use their phones so much that when they get behind the wheel they forget that you can't text and drive over 4000 driving accidents happen because somebody was texting and driving. These accidents happened because they wouldn't pay attention to the road because that text was so important to them and now somebody has either died or ended up in the hospital because of them. Each year a child under the age of 18 has died because of a car accident because of texting and driving.

90% of the day somebody is driving with their phones in their hands. When you drive your main focus should be on the road and not on your cell phone. Phones are like addictions because if you haven't had your phone in your hand all day you feel lost which isn't good. If you can't take 10 minutes out the day to pay attention to the road when you get behind the wheel then you shouldn't be driving. When someone is on their phone while driving they claim they were on checking and email or answering a call and sometimes that isn't true they were texting and driving and not paying attention to the road.

There are some people out here that thinks they know how to text and drive like pro. I don't think they should be touching a wheel because having that mentality could get someone killed because they want to drive reckless. Driving while on your phones should really stop because everybody deserves to make it home to their family at the end of the day. Over these last four years phones and driving has cause a lot of deaths to the youth and it's mainly teens who do the texting and driving but some adults should take some responsibly because they do it too or they learn from so if you have your kids in the car with you while your texting and driving stop because they're going to start doing what you do because they feel like they have control over the car like you do.

So as you can see I don't agree with phones and driving it should be taken seriously because people are out here losing their life because somebody decided to pick up their phone and see who was texting them.75% of those who text while driving make it home to their families at night most don't so put down the phone for the ones who don't make it home.

"Many people believe that the landform on Mars was created by Aliens. Many Web sites, magizenes and people do not have enough information to correcty assume that the Face on Mars is an Alien monument or creation. Many people just guess without really having adiquite information. We do have enough information to know that when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Mars and took pictures of the Face it was not Alien made.

We know for a fact that the Face on Mars is not an Alien creation. The first Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) or the Viking 1 took blurry photos of the Face on Mars and we could not clearly see the object. Twenty-five years later the MGS was sent to take better quality pictures of the Face and when it came back, the photos were ten times more sharper than the Viking 1´s. Now we could clearly speculate that the Face was just another Mars landform.

On Earth there are simialr landforms like the Snake River in Idaho. We have found that the Face is a lava dome under the surface of Mars. We understand how much of an influence the Media can have and you shouldn´t believe them. Again, they do not have as much information as we do on the Face on mars. Thanks to our new pictures from the MGS, we can safely say that there is no Alien temple or monument on Mars.        ";0
"How was the Face on Mars created? The face on Mars was created, because it is a mesa, meaning no alien created it. Many scientist believed it was an alien artifact, even though there weren't any facts given about it. The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

On April 5, 1998 a team of men snapped a photograph ten times sharper than the one the Viking took. Once the photo was uploaded many people were unhappy. The people still believed it still had something to do with the aliens because of where it was located. The Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, giving them a reason to believe it was an alien artifact.

The Face on Mar became a pop icon. ""It starred in a Hollywood fim, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" (5) The Face on Mars became famous because many people believed it was an alien artifact and didn't know the truth.

The Face on Mars has nothing to do with aliens, it is a natural landform, also know as a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars was never an alien monument, even though many people just believed it was. It became famous for it, an once people found out the truth then weren't satified with it.

The Face on Mars was finally unmasked. Everyone found out the truth and dealt with it, even though most weren't satified about it. The Face on Mars is a natural landform and has nothing to do with aliens.";0
"You´re in chemistry and you have no idea what the teacher it talking about. This is the third time this week going over chemical equations and the fact that you still don´t understand it, is embarassing. So you don´t ask for help. What if the teacher knew based soley on your facial expressions? Using the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would be valuable to students who are unconfident in asking questions and to students who really care about their education.

Well known, some students struggle with verbal communication. They are shy, socially underdeveloped, or just uncomfortable with holding a conversation. If there was a device like the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in classrooms, it would help teachers know who understands and who doesn´t. Who still needs help and who doesn´t. This could be the difference between passing or failing.

Students go through a lot with life-changing tests, and pressures to be successful in life. With the FACS, teachers will be able to sense when a student is unwilling or not trying; teachers will know to not waste valuable time on them. These types of attitudes are contagious especially in a classroom. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, we unconciously imitate eachother´s facial expressions and moods. This means other students won´t want to learn either.

In conclusion, having the FACS in classrooms would be helpful to students and educators. Some teachers lack patience while some students lack confidence. Having a device that could sort all that out and make room for real learning, would be grand.";0
"Technology and Driving

Have you ever been riding in the car and looked over at a red light and saw someone on their phone? I see it all the time when I go places with my parents, though we know it is illegal today in GA and other state people still do it. Driving is an activity that requires all your attention. My mom would always you are not only driving for yourself but for everyone on the road. No one should be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle to ensure safety for all drivers and even pedestrians.

Being a driver means you are responsible for your life and others driving and existing around you. Unfortunately, driving accident statistics gathered by edgarsnyder. com says, 1out of every 4 accidents in the US is caused by phone use while driving. That is a large portion of accidents and if we cannot use our phones while driving to rid a quarter of accidents then its worth it. The countless amounts of stories about parents and friends losing loved ones to accidents is an untimely loss that can never be justified, and we should do everything we can to spare people from a hurt such as that.

Outside of accidents leading to loss of life because of cell phone use while driving there is also the issue of distractions. A cellphone is like a computer, a MP3 player, a videogame and many other entertaining things wrapped up in one. Using this addictive piece of technology while driving is like asking for a distraction and distractions or lack of awareness of the road leads to car crashes. There might not be any deaths, but a car crash is still something to avoid. Raising your car insurance? A bad thing. Having to get your car or parent's car repaired? A bad and expensive thing. A distracted driver is a driver more likely to crash and damage their own and others' property.

There are some cars that have automated cellphone connection and touchless operations. Those vehicles do prevent the distractions, but you could still argue it is still just as bad as drunk driving. Your eyes may be on the road, but your attention is focused towards voice commands to your cellphone. It may be loosely related, but you can still be so focused on listening to that text and voicing a response that you alert enough for all the unexpected things that can happen on the road. People find that to be the compromise, but it's also seen as a mental distraction.

Overall cellphones just should not be matched with an activity such as driving. Driving should be a moment to unplug and focus even GPS can be used without the use of your cellphone. Cellphones have been proven to cause car accidents, distractions and crashes. Just keep your hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and attention focused and your cell phone will be waiting on you when you get to your destination.

"Many students are assigned projects over the summer that are to be given to the teacher upon return to school. There is an ongoing debate over students summer projects being student-designed. Those who disagree state that students will be set up for failure and that they will not have enough work on their project, but this is not true. Although some may disagree student-designed summer projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed summer projects.

There are many reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. When doing a school project you normally have guidelines, but if students design it themselves they will not have guidelines. The only thing about not having guidelines is that it must be appropriate for school. When teachers assign summer projects your stuck inside a box, but when you create your own project you can be more creative and think outside the box. The more creative you are the better chance you have of passing. Many teachers assign boring projects like reading a book and writing an essay, but if a student designs it you will have better topic choices, you can do it according to your knowledge.

There are further reasons why summer projects should not be teacher-designed. Students can come up with many ideas; what you got out of the school year, your school environment, and what you learned that school year. Many students like to be able to get their point across or express how they feel. Freedom of expression is very important and very beneficial when students come up with their own project. Even though summer projects are tiring it gives you a chance to be different. Being different play a big role going through school. You can show how different you are through a simple summer project.

Although some may disagree, student-designed summer projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed summer projects. Those who agree with summer projects being student-designed state that students will have freedom of expression, A chance to be different, and A better chance of passing. Those who disagree with summer projects being student-designed state that, students will be set up for failure, and that they will not have enough work on their project but this is not true. This topic is important because some of the students are stuck to doing one thing how the teacher wants them to do it. Many students want to be able to express themselves and come up with their own ideas. Having students do a project that they designed will be much more entertaining and will give them a chance to step outside the box and be different. ";0
"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is smart and could be usefull but, it could also be a bad idea. Being able to know everything that the student is feeling can help teachers understand them more. If a student was in danger and didn't feel safe the teacher would know and be able to help them. Teachers will have to ask their students if its okay to read their emotions because peoples emotions are very personal.

A teacher being able to uderstand students through their emotion can help teachers know more about how to work with them. For example, in the article this is said by Dr. Huang ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". According to this part of the text computers know how to change a lesson based off your emotion. That means that teachers being able to know your emotion can do the same.

I also feel that this is invading someones personal space. If someone wanted you to know what was going on in their life and wanted you to know how they are feeling they will tell you. Thats why I think asking for the students permission is important before updating their technology. Another thing is why understand computers, in the passage this is said ""developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"" but why? I dont think computers and humans need to communicate but, I do think humans need to communicate with other humans. I feel that you don't need technology to know how someone is feeling because you could just talk to them if you think something is wrong or if they arn't understanding the lesson that you are trying to teach them.";0
"Limiting car use can be a good thing and a bad thing. In my opinion i think that people should be able to drive cars but only at certain times to limit polution. in europe as staded ""while their have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs...."".

in this storey you can teel that alot of these people in europe are not liking the fact that their is polution going on. ""all of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" (paragraph 7). i can agree sort of with this because we focus on cars alot as one of our major ways of transportation. this is not a bad thing that we have cars but we need to make sure that we can keep the polution down by maybe using hybrid cars instead.

it also seems that people are starting to drive less nowadays, and in my opinion it is because either gas prices are too high or people cannot afford one.""americas love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, acording to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives, an invesment research company as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995"" (paragraph 32). as you can see i was stating how the number of people driving has declined. also i believe the cause for this as i stated before is due to the number of people who can either not afford one or do not want one.

in this storey i have explained how the number of people driving cars have declined.

i have also said that europe does not really like the idea of the polution they are creating since they end up making so much smog. In my opinion maybe other countrys such as the U.S.A or canada and such should consider knocking down some of their driving privilages due to the fact that it is just too loud and not very safe as well as creating alot of polution.

"The old adage, ""If you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will grow,"" holds true in life. If we are static in our knowledge and in our experiences, we risk not developing our full potential. Taking on something that is beyond our current level of expertise stretches us and encourages us to develop better skills and learn more about the topic. It is from these out-of-the-box pursuits that we have the capability to achieve greater levels of growth. 

For example, a professional tennis player might be considered to have already mastered the game of tennis. But if this player takes on a new development challenge by trying a different type of shot or by changing his or her grip in order to improve, the growth potential is immense. Similarly, a mathematician who has already earned a degree can grow further by taking on a more challenging problem or exploring a new area of mathematics. 

Growth comes from pushing ourselves to explore our capabilities beyond what we currently know. We often become complacent when we feel we have mastered something, and this can halt our development. But when we push past our comfort zone and try something new, our ability to grow and expand our knowledge is limitless.";1
"If you want good advice would you rather have the good advice because of multiple people's ideas or be lazy and only ask one person for advice and it will be a more likely a mediocre opinion. When asking for multiple opinions on a subject you most likely can thrive in what the advice was for. When people ask for advice,they often talk to multiple people because of better opinions,different ideas,and most people when asking for advice they would not be lazy and ask multiple people.

When people are asking for advice,they often talk to multiple people because they might have a better opinion because they could have thought of something that you have not come up with and that could help them majorly or it could help them in a minor way but it still helps them. When I ask for advice I want to find a common idea throughout all the people I ask because that could a common and a better way to do the thing I am asking for. The opinion could be smarter and move thought out because people give different advice. When giving advice you tell them most of the time what you would do in there situation and based on your experiences that makes your answer. When you are getting opinions you can build trust with that because they can use there advice and it works they can now depend on your judgments on certain things or maybe everything depending on the person. In my experience when I use the advice that a person has given to me it helps form a bond because I know I can trust that person with there judgment on that certain subject. In conclusion when people ask for your advice, they will most of the time talk to another person about it also but they do it so they can get a better opinion because of people thinking of something you haven't,smarter or more efficient opinions,and can build trust with a person because they give you a better opinion.

When people ask for advice,they often talk to multiple people because everybody might have different ideas or opinions. When getting different ideas it can help you because you can see in a new and different perspective and a new outlook and there advice could mean something totally different then what you thought it meant. When I learned about a new perspective I looked at different things in two perspectives and now if people ask for advice then I become more versatile became of the depth I have in this area and I can look at it two ways. There is always another method and that is to combine both ideas and or opinions together to make one really good piece of advice. If I were to combine two ideas that are both good the opinions on it will not be the same as having one piece of good advice because of the value each one has and the importance that each one has and combining two good piece of opinions together they advice can give more help and is going to be a efficient and it will be better advice. When you start combining opinions together it starts to become a habit and it will be a good work habit because when you are working in groups you can get better feedback to the bettering of the group. When I started asking for different opinions in group work or group projects it helped me better than someone else just doing it for me then the group has different ideas thriving and making it a successful project or piece of work we are doing. In closing when people ask for opinions, they often talk to multiple people because they want different ideas and or opinions because they can get a new perspective,they can combine ideas,and they can create good working habits.

People think that just one person is enough to ask for advice but what if the advice is not good and it very one sided or a mediocre advice? If you ask for advice and the advice is not good then asking only one person is a lose-lose situation and then you start to lose trust in that person because of the failed advice and then something might happen since the advice has failed. If you ask multiple people what they say you can combine your's and there's and have a more than decent advice then have a set up to fail advice. If you are being lazy and only asking one person for advice it is more of a lose-lose situation then a win-win situation because of the failure that is awaiting you and even if the advice works it will not work as well as asking multiple people for the same advice. I have only asked one person for advice before and the advice ended up not working and then something bad happened after because of only asking one person and evidently I found out that asking more people is more efficient and better than asking only one. In summary when people act lazy and only ask one person instead of asking more there is more of a loss then gain and that is why asking the same question to multiple people are efficient.

I believe that you should ask multiple for advice before making your final answer. If you ask for advice you should ask multiple people because of the better opinions,the different ideas,and most of the time people will not be lazy about asking for advice. I believe that when asking for advice for multiple people it helps you understand in different ways and helps you grow on your way of thinking and in a way makes you more knowledgeable.";0
"Everyone has their own opinion on the way our Presidents are elected. Some say they would prefer popular votes rather than electoral votes, while others believe we should keep it the same way. I believe that it is more fair and less kayotic having popular votes rather than electoral votes. I believe that popular votes keep it fair when it comes to choosing a Presidant and does not cause a lot of fights. Although I believe this some say that electoral voting is also safe and keeps people under control.

Some United states citizens, including me, believe popular votes are more fair and are more of peoples choices. Lots of citizens believe that with electoral votes it's not fair because with electoral votes candidates don't spend time in all the states, some states don't even see campaign ads. Also it's fair because that means that lots of people truly want that candidate for Presidant. Just like when Al Gore won the popular votes, which mean more poeple like him and thought he would be a great President, lost the whole campaign cause of electoral votes. Citizens also get more say if it were for just popular votes and with elctoral votes not so much because even if their is a tie people don't choose, House of Representatives do.

As for others they are completly against popular votes and think that electoral votes are more safe and calming for many reasons. It keeps it fair because it isn't based off which candidate put more comersuals out there or who people know more. With electoral voting you are voting for the electors in The Electoral College who then vote themsevles and are then are counted by Congress. Also with electoral votes not lots of arguing could happen. With popular votes people may begin to argue about who deserved it more cause more peple knew him rather than the other candidate. ""Also it more fair because each state has their own group of electors so they know who is better for their state."" (source 1, paragraph 5)

Although everyone ahs their opinions I believe that popular votes are a better way to vote rather than electoral voting because it's more fair to citizens and less kayotic. Their are many facts and evidence in this world and i history to show that popular voting is more aficient than electoral voting.    ";0
"Imagine summer break coming to an end you would want to make memories with friends and family, but you can't because you have to do your summer project. When it comes to summer assignments many students will put it off until the last moment. They will do this for a number of reasons maybe they were on vacation, had trouble with their family, or just didn't like the assignment. Regardless of the reason in the last moments of summer they must rush to complete this assignment for the next school year. Summer projects should be student-designed because of students interest, schedules, and emotional health.

Summer assignments should be student-designed because of different students interest. Some students may be interested in math while others might like science or history more. If a student likes math but is required to do a history summer assignment they will not want to do it because they are not motivated to do something they do not like. Some may say that regardless of what classes students like they will do the assignment anyways because they have to. While that is true it would be better to let the students choose what they want instead of trying to force them to continue learning over summer break.

Students schedules are not always as simple as teachers think so giving a lot of work to do over the summer might not be best for them. Students have a lot going on in their daily lives spending time with friends, sports, religion, and family emergencies. These are some things that constantly impact students lives on a daily basis, and if they are dealing with a lot over the summer they might have difficulties finding time to do the assignments teachers give them. Although most students have a lot going on so it not a valid reason for students to put off their work or not do it. However students know their schedule better than teachers they could design a project that they could fit into their schedules and complete on time.

Students in their teens or lower are often feeling many emotions through the year but teachers probably don't think about that as they assign summer projects. A student getting a project they don't think they can handle while they are dealing with a lot at home could push them to make a bad decision like doing drugs or getting in a fight. Students could be feeling stressed, angry, or sad and getting an assignment they might not think they can handle could make them act out in unpredictable ways. Some may say that getting a project has no impact on a students emotion health. However the fact is all students have different conditions that they live or grew up in so when teachers assign projects they can't assume that all students are fine. If students could chose their own summer assignments they could chose something that would not feel so overwhelming to them.

The whole point of summer break is so students get a chance to relax and prepare themselves for the next school year. While it is important for students to do a little work so they don't forget what they have learned so far, teachers should not force the work on them and they should not feel like it is too much to handle. In the past teachers designed the summer projects and students just had to deal with it but that system is flawed. Does it really help students review what they have already learned? What's to stop them from copying the assignment from a friend. Going forward students should have the choice to design their own summer project with the help of a teacher. While it is best for them to feel comfortable and want to keep learning over the summer teachers need to make sure that it covers the right material and that it is not too easy.";0
"John Lubbock was a British naturalist and politician who made significant contributions to the fields of natural history and politics. Born in 1836, Lubbock was a self-taught naturalist who began his career as a teacher before turning his attention to the study of natural history.

One of Lubbock's major accomplishments was his work on the study of prehistoric man. He was one of the first people to study the remains of early humans, and his work helped to establish the field of prehistory. Lubbock's work on prehistoric man also helped to dispel some of the myths and misconceptions about early humans that were prevalent at the time.

In addition to his work on prehistory, Lubbock was also a prominent political figure. He was a member of the Liberal Party and served as a member of parliament for several terms. Lubbock's political career was marked by his commitment to social reform and his advocacy for the rights of workers.

Lubbock's success as a politician and naturalist can be attributed to his ability to make his own decisions. Unlike many other British politicians of his time, Lubbock was not bound by the traditional political ideologies of his time. Instead, he was guided by his own beliefs and values, which allowed him to forge his own path and create a unique difference in the political world.

Lubbock's ability to make his own decisions was also a key factor in his success as a naturalist. Unlike many other naturalists of his time, Lubbock was not content to simply follow the established scientific methods of his time. Instead, he was willing to challenge conventional wisdom and develop his own methods for studying the natural world. This willingness to think outside the box allowed Lubbock to make significant contributions to the field of natural history.

In conclusion, John Lubbock's ability to make his own decisions was a key factor in his success as both a politician and a naturalist. By following his own beliefs and values, Lubbock was able to forge his own path and create a unique difference in the political world. Similarly, by challenging conventional wisdom and developing his own methods for studying the natural world, Lubbock was able to make significant contributions to the field of natural history. Overall, Lubbock's ability to make his own decisions";1
"It's a week before your junior year starts. You're laying in bed, soaking up your last few days of freedom. Then it hits you- you have a book report due the first day of school. Panic sets in, chaos erupts. Oh, the joy of summer projects. Most students have been through the process of completing a summer project. In most circumstances, these projects are a strict set of directions created by the teacher. Summer projects are expected, especially when taking difficult classes. Students, due to different commitments, should be able to design their own summer projects.

Teenagers today are exposed to a lot more than when our parents were our age. Some of those things aren't beneficial, such as too much screen time or drinking underage. But, a lot of this exposure is good. We're exposed to different cultures at an early age, we have easier access to education, and we know when disaster strikes, it's our responsibility to help. Because of all this new exposure, students often make commitments over the summer. Students accepted into college summer programs go to learn more about something their interested in. Some make the world a better place by doing service with a church group or other organizations. College is expensive, so a large quantity of teenagers get a summer job to save up money. There's always going to be the group of teenagers who sit at home all summer watching TV and eating junk food. With this wide variety of responsibilities and commitments, having every student complete the same exact summer project is unreasonable.

At most schools, you don't meet your teacher until a week prior to school starting. Knowing nothing about the class is a scary thought if you're spending hours a day working on a summer project, assigned by a teacher you've never met. If students know nothing about a teacher and the class they lead, how are they supposed to know if they're going to stay in the class? It's ridiculous to ask for a teenager to commit to an intensive project when they might only be in the class for a day. Most schools that allow schedule changes will forget about that grade if you drop the class early on into the school year. It may be nice that you don't have to be in that class anymore, but hours upon hours of your life were wasted on a project you'll never get a grade for. If students were able to design their own summer project, it would not only give them creative freedom but allow them to feel proud of what they turn in, regardless if they stay in the class. No student enjoys writing an essay every time they do a project, so if the projects were created by students the final results could be even more outstanding than what any teacher could've designed.

If students are designing their own summer projects, it not only shows their personality and character- it raises their expectations for the class in the best way possible. Most teachers want their students to be excited for their class. Even if the class course is torturous, a teacher who loves their job can make all the difference in the world. If a teacher gives their students the freedom of creating their own summer project, the students will have a good image of the teacher. Students that enjoy a class tend to be the ones who do the best. Most teenagers don't enjoy being tied down by rules, so getting them excited for a class that has rules is the ideal situation.

Summer projects aren't a bad thing. They not only keep a student's brain activated during the summer, but they give them a taste of a class before they commit fully. Because of all the opportunities we have as teenagers in today's age, our schedules can get pretty busy. Although, I do still think an education is important. Summer projects allow students to ease themselves back into the routine of the school year before it hits them like a train. If those projects are student designed, it allows us to learn about time and self management. They also allow us to express our creativity. I'm not saying someone who draws a stick figure should get the same credit as someone who writes a five page essay. In my ideal situation, the teacher can give their students a vague set of directions so the students are free to express themselves. ";0
"Fellow citizens cars are dying out. Every year more and more people are realizing the cultural and natural impact that cars are having on us in a negative way. There are many advantages that come with eliminating cars from society. For one reason is that we can start to eliminate roads and highways and use that land for houses or something else. Another reason is that it will help the world out in a natural way to stop tempatures from sky rocketing to completely melting the polar cap, and prevent smog from building up in dense cities. Citezens also wont have to spend money on fuel or a car anymore and can save money.

As soon as citizens completely wipe out the use of cars then alot of positives will result out of it. As soon as cars are out of the picture then societies can use up the space from highways and roads to make houses and shopping centers that are walking distance from those houses or living communities. When people need to drive long disctances to get to another destination thats far away from where they live then they can take theyre car thats on the outskirt of the city in a protected garage, just like they do in Vauban, Germany, they do this in order to keep the city within completely safe and pollutant free from cars.

Up to now and ever since the invention of automobiles like buses and cars the world has changed dramatically in tempature. Earth has become like a microwave just trapping heat from the Greenhouse effect which causes the carbon dioxide from the cars to stay in earth andn not expell to space which has caused some of the highest tempatures in the last 100 years. With the elimination of cars less carbon dioxide will be let out causing the eart to cool and thus will help save the polar ice caps. Not only will it save the cold areas of the world but it will also help reduce smog in densley packed cities like Paris and Bieging. Up to now cities like Paris and Bogota have had certain days where they prohibit the use of cars in the city to help and calm the smog down. This Method has helped dramatically and it was only for one day! Imagine what doing this forever can do for the enviroment.

Another topic for eliminating the use of cars is the economic change it will postively have on the enviroment. For one families wont have to spend money on gas. Second they wont have to spend money for a car. Last but not least third they wont have to spend money on tolls or tickets. So simply if you dont have a car you wont have to worry about any of those problems. Families can use all of that saved money for going on vacations or on themselves.    ";0
"In most cases, it is simply naive to believe that ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" Problems require both time and energy to solve, making them a significant challenge to conquer. As such, it is not always easy for an individual to perform optimally when faced with a problem. Consider the example of someone who has been struggling with an addiction for many years. Despite the many challenges and hardships that have been faced, this individual has failed to make progress in overcoming their problem. This situation clearly demonstrates that simply labelling a problem as an opportunity to do one's best is not an effective solution.

Furthermore, some individuals acquire a bad habit of repeating the same mistakes over and over again. This repetition prevents them from growing and developing as a person, and can cause them to be stuck in a stagnant pattern of behavior. When a person is failing to learn from their mistakes, it is highly unlikely that they could adequately address a new problem using their best efforts.

Though some may argue that facing a problem is beneficial, as it allows one to be proactive and seek assistance from the resources needed to solve the problem, this has the potential to come at a cost. For some individuals, the consequences of their current problems may be too great for them to handle. They may have to confront the difficult consequences of the problem, with no ability to perform at their best to address the issue.

Therefore, it is evident that ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" is not always a sound philosophy. The best way to succeed in life is often by making fewer mistakes, rather than relying on the ""chance"" to do your best when presented with a problem.";1
"Dear senator

I think we should change to election by popular vote because so that everyone can vote, but in the passage ''The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors,the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president''. They are trying to say that the president only get majorirty of 270 electorals votes but i think if every each person vote like the house of representative and plus two sentors it be a equal number then it will be easier for him so for my oppion  we should change to eletion by popular

Well each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. for example, the electors are generally choosend by the candidate political party, but state laws vary on how the electors selected. and did you know that when u vote for president you help choose a elector because when u vote for them u voteing for your candidate electors. and before we have won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. so now i am saying reading the passage is very cool with facts telling me what i should pick  but i think by reading it we should change to eletion by popular vote for the president of the u. s. a. so they can choose who should be our electors or candidates ,and rather than people who think a single vote may decide an eletion.            ";0
"The idea of a four-day school week with ten-hour days has been gaining popularity in recent years. While some argue that this schedule would provide numerous benefits to students, others claim that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter.

On the one hand, proponents of a four-day school week argue that it would provide students with more time for extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, and clubs. They also argue that it would give students more time to focus on their studies and allow them to catch up on any missed work. Additionally, a four-day school week would give students more time to spend with their families and friends, which could improve their mental health and overall well-being.

On the other hand, opponents of a four-day school week argue that it would disrupt the learning schedule and make it difficult for students to keep up with their coursework. They also argue that it would require teachers to work longer hours, which could lead to burnout and reduced job satisfaction. Furthermore, a four-day school week would require students to attend school for longer hours each day, which could lead to fatigue and decreased productivity.

In my opinion, the potential advantages and disadvantages of a four-day school week are fairly balanced. While it would provide students with more time for extracurricular activities and improve their mental health, it could also disrupt the learning schedule and make it difficult for students to keep up with their coursework.

Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week should be made based on the specific needs and circumstances of the school and its students. If the school can provide adequate support and resources to help students manage their time effectively, then a four-day school week could be a beneficial change. However, if the school cannot provide this support, then it could lead to negative consequences for students and teachers alike.

In conclusion, the potential advantages and disadvantages of a four-day school week with ten-hour days are complex and multifaceted. While it could provide students with more time for extracurricular activities and improve their mental health, it could also disrupt the learning schedule and make it difficult for students to keep up with their coursework. Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week should be made";1
"Driving a car is not a necessity in life and countries are starting to realize that. A car is merely ""just a means of getting from [point] A to B"" (Source 4). The stress and pollution caused by these vehicles is not worth it for some countries. They would rather have less stressed people, less pollution and less traffic accidents and congestion in the streets.

Germany believes that the lifestyle of driving a car is not neccessary. ""There are only two places to park - large garages [] where a car owner can buy a space"" (Source 1) These parking spaces cost $40,000, and the car owner buys this space along with a house. As a result of this phenomenon ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars"" (Source 1) and 57 percent of people sold their car and chose to move to Vauban, Germany. Cars are ""responsible for 12 percent of greehouse gas emissions in Europe"" (Source 1). Yet there have been efforts to lower the greenhouse gases, Vauban put a stop to cars to make the citites nice, and better for walking.

Paris is one of the most known tourist destinations in the world. People cluster in from around the world to see the Effiel Tower, which stands straight into the sky. Their main tourist attraction is a monument that goes into the sky. No wonder they want to cut down on cars' pollution. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" (Source 2).

A home to 7 million people, Bogota, Colombia is trying to spread their program globally and reduce the pollution from the once nessecary cars. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (Source 3). Violaters are faced with $25 fines. In a car free day, ""the turnout was large"" (Source 3). It is believed to be a great oppurtunity to relieve stress and lower air pollution. Bogota's program is ""generating a revolutionary change"" (Source 3) and the idea is spreading across borders.

""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"" (Source 4). The United States is one of the top most prosperous countries in the world and the culture revolves around transportation. Americans depend on their cars to help them preform their daily lives. The explaination of the ""cooling of vehicles"" is a result of unemployment and the recession. Many Americans are ""cash-strapped"" (Source 4), and cannot afford new cars. If the pattern of car ownership continues to decrease, it will benefit the environment with less pollution and car emissions. But, a negative results for the car industry's.

Pedestrians, bicycles, cars, commerical and public transportation all play a crucial role in the lives of people across the globe. They are ""woven into a connected network"" (Source 4) to save time, resources, pollution and promote safety.    ";0
"Some schools require to complete summer projects to make sure students continue to learn over the break.

The pros of when teachers design summer projects they are preping students for the start of the new year and also seeing what students strengths are also, what weakens students. The pros of when students design summer projects are that, they can choose what they want to work on and find something that interests them. That position I am taking in this prompt is, student-designed and here's why.

Yes teachers want to test us on knowledgeable subjects and stories ,but sometimes I believe it is to much on a student not everyone learns the same. Students should be given an equal oppurtunity to do summer projects.

If a student designs the project he or she may actually fin it interesting because, they can do what they want to do instead recieving a designed project from the teacher. Like examples for boys would be different types of sports, all types of cars, marketing, music industry, and many more. For girls it would be cooking, benefits on keeping your hair clean, acting, traveling, and much more. This gives students the oppurtunity to express themselves instead of a teacher thinking that, maybe this is a good topic or that one. Also doing something like this is fair for each student.

As of being a student we also have a lot of activities going on over the summer such as working, sports, traveling to different states, and countries and even more. I think that's another reason why we should design it ourselves. Teachers should also get a break as well because they work all year round so it would make sense for us to do it on our own.

Although teachers can be helpful with coming up with projects and designs. I believe that us as students should be the ones creating and designing our own projects over the summer. It gives us an equal oppurtunity to express are feelings and gives us a voice. That's what I have for you today and I hope I persuaded you enough on why students should design there own summer projects instead of teachers doing it for them.    ";0
"Hey there!  For this assignment, I researched the effects of having a positive and negative attitude on one's life. It's pretty cool how much of a difference it can make! 🤯

Having a positive attitude can do wonders for your life. For starters, it can make you happier and more optimistic. When you're positive, you're more likely to see the good in things and people, which can lead to stronger relationships and a more fulfilling life. Plus, a positive attitude can help you handle stress and challenges better. You're more likely to bounce back from setbacks and keep pushing forward. 💪

On the other hand, having a negative attitude can hold you back in so many ways. It can make you feel sad, anxious, and unmotivated. You might find yourself focusing on the bad things in life and missing out on all the good stuff. And when things get tough, a negative attitude can make it even harder to deal with. 😔

But here's the thing: having a positive attitude doesn't mean everything will always be sunshine and rainbows. It's okay to have bad days and face challenges. The important thing is to keep things in perspective and not let negative thoughts take over. When you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to find a way to solve problems and come out stronger on the other side. 💪

For example, let's say you want to get good grades in school. If you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to put in the effort and stay motivated. You might even find ways to make learning fun! But if you have a negative attitude, you might get discouraged and give up before you even try. 📚

So, it's super important to maintain a positive attitude in life. It can help you achieve your goals and make your life happier and more fulfilling. Plus, it's just way more fun to be around people who are positive and happy! 😊

In conclusion, having a positive attitude can make a huge difference in your life. It can help you handle challenges better, make you happier, and even help";1
"School ended for the day, everyone is tired and bored out of their mind, but at least they're going home! Unless the principal said students need to participate in an extracurricular activity. It's not fair when students might have other plans out side of school as if that's not tiring enough, or have to watch over younger siblings/pets.

Whether it may be sports, scouts, or even volunteer work, it's not fair for the principal to force students to take part in other events after-school as if they don't already have enough on their plate. Someone is coming home from school and they're rushing to get their sports gear on; that takes a bit long to get on not including other accessories included like water bottles, backpacks, training items and more, and now they're late because they had another event before whichever sport they're playing. Say a classmate is not doing so hot in class right now, and the reason is they had multiple activities that took place yesterday. The teacher/staff member want them to do well, but they can't do anything to change this person's mood, due to the fact of all tiring events. Service hours could count as an extracurricular activity, but who said nobody is doing that already? Speaking from experience, scouts get themselves into any volunteering opportunity open. It takes time and work to give back to others, but at least they're fulfilling their duties as a citizen of the community. It's exhausting, and stressful enough with other plans.

Being an only child is easier in this situation, but remember siblings and pets are also a thing too. Siblings, especially younger ones, need to be watched over, taken care of while parents are at work. It's not like anyone can take them to their school all because of staying after. That isn't aloud, or necessary when they have a house for a reason. Pets aren't a need, they're a privilege because of the huge responsibility over them. They need to be walked, fed, and loved especially if it's a baby animal. It's almost like caring for another human, if they were more hairy and spoke an entirely different language. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" someone once said, and it's pretty impressive youngsters are capable of caring for others besides themselves. A single child in school might not be the only one in their family like described.

Watching over another child/animal, or dealing with exhausting things to do after a long educational period of time, it's not fair to add something on top of someone's plate knowing all of this information. Even though students know different adults believe they can do it, sometimes they just want to catch their breathe for a second and release their stress. Children are capable, but maybe they're not up to the challenge 100% of the time.";0
"Science Experiment Report

Introduction:

As an 8th-grade student, I recently completed a science experiment with my group. Our goal was to investigate the effects of different types of fertilizers on plant growth. We chose this experiment because we were interested in understanding how plants grow and how different nutrients can affect their growth.

Experiment Design:

We decided to conduct a controlled experiment with three different types of fertilizers: organic, chemical, and a control group with no fertilizer. We planted three seeds of the same plant species in each group of three pots. We used the same amount of soil, water, and light for each group. We then applied the fertilizer to each group according to the instructions on the package.

Task Assignment:

Each member of the group was assigned a different task. One person was responsible for planting the seeds, another person was responsible for watering the plants, and the third person was responsible for recording the growth of the plants.

Supply and Materials:

We gathered the following supplies and materials for the experiment:

* Three types of fertilizer (organic, chemical, and a control group with no fertilizer)
* Three pots
* Soil
* Seeds of the same plant species
* Water
* Light source
* Ruler
* Notebook and pen for recording growth

Experiment Execution:

We followed the instructions carefully and made sure that each group received the same amount of soil, water, and light. We applied the fertilizer to each group according to the instructions on the package. We then watered the plants and placed them in a light source. We recorded the growth of the plants every week using a ruler.

Discussion and Reflection:

After the experiment was completed, we discussed the results as a group. We noticed that the plants in the organic fertilizer group grew the fastest, followed by the chemical fertilizer group, and the control group with no fertilizer grew the slowest. We also noticed that the plants in the organic fertilizer group had the healthiest appearance, with green leaves and strong stems.

We reflected on the process and outcomes of the experiment. We learned that different types of fertilizers can have different effects on plant growth. We also learned the importance of";1
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student in response to the prompt:

Extracurricular activities are a big part of school life, but have you ever wondered how they affect students? I did some research and found some really interesting things.

First, let's talk about stress levels. I know I feel super stressed out when I have too many extracurricular activities, like when I'm on the soccer team, in the school play, and in the debate club. It's hard to keep up with everything and sometimes I feel like I'm spreading myself too thin. But, surprisingly, research shows that doing extracurricular activities can actually help reduce stress levels! That's because they give you something else to focus on besides school work, so you don't feel so overwhelmed. Plus, you get to meet new people and make friends, which is also really important for reducing stress.

Next, let's talk about grades. I know some people who think that doing extracurricular activities will distract them from their school work and their grades will suffer. But, actually, the opposite is true! Research shows that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have better grades than those who don't. That's because they learn time management skills and how to balance different activities, which can help them in school too. Plus, doing extracurricular activities can actually help you learn new skills and knowledge that you can apply in your school work.

Finally, let's talk about family relationships. I know my parents get really excited when I tell them about my extracurricular activities, because they know it's good for me. Research shows that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have stronger family relationships too. That's because they have more things to talk about with their parents and can share their experiences with them. Plus, doing extracurricular activities can help students develop a sense of responsibility and accountability, which can also strengthen their relationships with their families.

In conclusion, doing extracurricular activities can have some really cool effects on students. They can help reduce stress levels, improve grades, and even strengthen family relationships. So, even though it can be hard to balance everything,";1
"Imagine the sound of the school bell ringing, freedom, time to go home, it is a Friday after all, you get to go home and relax; but then you remember the new rule, all students must be signed up for an extra curricular activity. There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other priorities whether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.

There is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they dont have enough time already and if forced to join a club that only meets once a week for an hour that just cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sports that are very time consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time consuming part of every child's life is family, spending time with grand parents or even just having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.

A huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.

To close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club dont want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it just makes everything worse. Also there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.

Kids shouldnt be required to be in an extra curricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many different things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.";0

The Importance of Failure in Pursuit of Success

Failure is something that everyone experiences at some point in their lives. It's easy to get discouraged when we don't achieve the desired outcome, but the truth is that failure is actually a crucial part of the journey to success. Without failure, we wouldn't learn how to persevere, how to problem solve, and how to improve.

Personally, I can relate to this concept. I worked hard for three years to get the supervisor position at my part-time job, but unfortunately, I didn't get it. At first, I was really upset and felt like I had failed. But then I started to reflect on why I didn't get the position. I realized that I didn't have as much experience as some of the other candidates, and that I could have prepared more for the interview.

Now, I'm faced with a decision: should I accept the offer for the supervisor position despite the extra requirements? On one hand, it would be a great opportunity to earn a higher salary and have more independence in my work. On the other hand, I would have to work longer hours and deal with more stress.

Pros of accepting the offer include the higher salary and more independence. As a supervisor, I would have more control over my work and be able to make decisions that would benefit the company. I would also be able to earn a higher salary, which would help me save money for college and other future expenses.

However, there are also some cons to consider. Working longer hours and dealing with more stress could be challenging, especially since I'm already balancing school and other extracurricular activities. Additionally, the extra requirements for the position may mean that I would have less free time to pursue my own interests and hobbies.

In the end, I decided to accept the offer for the supervisor position. Although it was a difficult decision, I knew that it was an opportunity that I couldn't pass up. I learned from my previous failure and am now more determined than ever to succeed in this new role.

In conclusion, failure is not the end of the";1
"An issue that many students have had for a long time in regards to attending classes at school is that it does not leave much time for other extracurricular activities or jobs. When you are working a part-time job, playing one or multiple sports, and attending school full time, these can place a heavy burden on an individual. Even if you are sick and miss only one or two days of school, you will have to make up several assignments in a very short period of time, which can put tremendous amounts of stress on students. There have been many proposed ideas that have attempted to solve this problem, and one of those ideas is having online classes. I believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are sick to not miss any assignments or content, it lets students who have multiple outside activities to have time to complete those activities, and it allows students to learn in a more quiet and stress-free environment without disturbances from other students.

Students who are sick are often advised not to come to school, and most students follow this advice. However, the downside to this is that students will often miss a full day of content they did not get to learn, or assignments that they did not get to complete. When a student returns to school, they will most likely not have a chance to learn the content they missed and as a result, these consequences can have negative effects on a student's grades. With online classes, a student can learn all the content that is being taught that day at home, which allows students to return to school being caught up with the rest of their class. For example, if a student was sick and missed calculus and English class, they could use their home or school computer to watch a live stream of the classes, or a previously recorded video which their teacher can assign to them that covers all the content the student needs to know. This system would benefit the student and it is a great reason why students should be able to attend classes from home.

The next reason as to why students should attend classes from home is that it allows students with jobs or other extracurricular activities such as sports, to work at their own pace. If a student is playing football, working a part-time job, and attending school, it makes it hard for them to balance all three of these activities. Having online classes allows these students to work at a faster pace and complete their assignments quicker, leaving more time for other activities such as work and sports. Because of this, students are no longer under pressure to find a way to balance out multiple activities at once and therefore, can be much more productive in terms of playing sports and working a part-time job, while also being able to attend classes without being slowed down by the pace of the rest of the class.

The third reason as to why having online classes is beneficial is that students can have the opportunity to learn in a stress-free and more quiet environment in their home, rather than a large classroom with twenty or more students. Being in a classroom with so many other students will more than likely cause disruptions that can affect a student's ability to learn what is being taught and as a result, negatively impact a student's grades. Online classes can easily resolve this problem by letting students learn within the comfort of their own home. This is especially beneficial for students who work best without distractions or interruptions. Another benefit of online classes is if a student is watching a previously recorded video of a lesson, the student can simply rewind the video to review any content they may have misunderstood. This is much better than asking a teacher to go back to a certain part of the lesson in an actual classroom, because it may be holding up other students who want to move forward. Also, students can also work at their own pace without the distractions of a normal classroom. Therefore, online classes can help students overcome challenges that students may experience at school.

Using all of the aforementioned reasons, it is clear to see why students would benefit from being able to attend online conferences or live streams of classes at home rather than school. The benefits outweigh the costs with online classes, with the only real negative factor of online classes being the lack of social interaction with friends that students may only see at school. However, there are many more positives than negatives in regards to online classes, and I firmly believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.";0

8. Consider the potential benefits of taking on a different role or pursuing a different goal altogether.
9. Reflect on the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity.
10. Evaluate the role of luck and chance in achieving success.

It is widely accepted that failure is an essential component of the pursuit of success. In fact, many successful individuals have credited their success to their failures. Failure provides valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. When we fail, we are forced to reevaluate our approach and make changes that can ultimately lead to success.

Unfortunately, I did not achieve the desired position after working hard for three years. Despite my best efforts, I was not able to meet the requirements and was ultimately unsuccessful in my pursuit. It was a difficult and frustrating experience, but it taught me a valuable lesson.

I have considered whether the supervisor position is still desirable in spite of the extra requirements asked. While the position does offer a higher salary and more independence, it also requires additional responsibilities and a busy work environment. I must weigh the pros and cons and determine if the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

I took several actions that led to my failure in achieving the desired position. Firstly, I did not fully understand the requirements and expectations of the position. I did not do enough research and did not seek out guidance from more experienced individuals. Additionally, I did not have the necessary skills and experience to meet the requirements.

External factors, such as competition and economic conditions, also played a role in my failure. There were other candidates who had more experience and qualifications, and the economic downturn made it difficult for me to find a job in my field.

To learn from my failure, I have reflected on the actions I took and the mistakes I made. I have also sought out guidance from more experienced individuals and have taken steps to improve my skills and qualifications. I have also considered the potential benefits of taking on a different role or pursuing a different goal altogether.

"Dear Principle,

I sincerely hope you will not have to take such severe actions as to ban cell phones from school no matter what because that truly would not be a good idea. I think you should allow students to bring their phones and permit them to use their phones during free periods and lunch periods as long as they aren't disturbing people in class, which won't happen because you will make students turn their phones off during class and/or take them from them during class and give the phones back after class. This would cause the students to pay attention no matter what, even though the students already do pay attention.

Taking away all phone privileges would be wrong a dangerous very, very dangerous. What would happen if an armed person came into the school and the school's telephone lines were cut? There would be no way to contact the police or anybody to help with the situation. I say this because if students aren't allowed to have phones teacher's shouldn't be able to have phones at school either. That would be unequal rights, a form of segregation, so to speak. Students are not suppose to use phones during school at all and students very rarely break that rule. However, all the time students see their teachers using their phones. That is a bad example because that sends the message to the students that its okay to break the rule and use your phone during school. If you ban phones from students you have to band phones from teachers as well. That brings me back to the beginning of this paragraph. With no phones allowed to students or teachers there would be no way to contact help. That is a very serious problem and that should be more of a concern than whether students can have phones in school or not if they don't use them during class.

Suppose a teacher sees a student with a phone out in class, will happen? The teacher should take the phone away and not give it back until the end of class. No big deal. However you are saying that the teachers don't catch the students using their cell phones during class, well then they should make sure at the beginning of class that there phones are off and that they keep them on their desk so the teacher can see if they are using them or not. Or the teacher could just take everyone's phone at the beginning of class and not have to worry about it. That is a plus because students don't need phones during class anyway. I'm saying that the students don't need phones in class not all together no phones. I am saying this because some students have games on their phones that they can play during open periods or at lunch. That isn't affecting anything or anyone because they have an open period so there is no teacher to annoy by using their phone and they have a ton of time on their hands so they want to make there time fun. The video may have persuaded you the wrong way. Students dont really use there phone that much. Besides most of those examples were during free periods or free time that the student has. That would lead you to believe that the students should be able to use their phones during free time and that cell phones rarely affect the class and or class work.

In the video only one time does it show that a students phone is being used during class. The others are in the hallway, outside, or in a place where their phones won't disturb anyone around them. That is a big positive. Students don't try to annoy teachers they, it just happens that sometimes a random student gets bored and uses their phone but that only happens like once or twice.

In conclusion, I don't think you should ban phones that woul";0
"Working in a group versus working alone on an assigned task has been a topic of debate among students and professionals alike. While some people argue that working in a group is more effective, others believe that working alone is the best approach. In this essay, I will compare the pros and cons of each approach and argue that working alone is the best approach for completing an assigned task.

One of the main benefits of working in a group is the ability to share ideas and perspectives. When working with a group of people, each individual brings their own unique perspective and experiences to the table. This can lead to a more well-rounded and creative solution to the task at hand. Additionally, working in a group can provide a sense of community and support. When working with others, it can be easier to share struggles and seek help when needed.

However, working in a group also has its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for groupthink. When a group of people are working together, they may become too focused on reaching a consensus and may overlook alternative solutions or ideas. This can lead to a less effective solution and a lack of creativity. Additionally, working in a group can be time-consuming and may require more communication and coordination than working alone.

On the other hand, working alone has its own set of benefits. One of the main advantages is the ability to work at your own pace and in your own style. When working alone, you have complete control over how you approach the task and can tailor your work to your own strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, working alone can be less distracting and allow for a more focused work environment.

However, working alone also has its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for isolation. When working alone, it can be difficult to get feedback and support from others. This can lead to a lack of accountability and may result in a less effective solution. Additionally, working alone can be lonely and may not provide the same sense of community and support as working in a group.

In conclusion, both working in a group and working alone have their own set of benefits and drawbacks. While working in a group can provide a sense of community and support, it can also lead to groupthink and a lack of creativity. Working alone, on the other hand, allows for more control and focus, but can also lead to isolation and a";1

The reason why people ask multiple people cause everybody has a different opion on the same questions. Not all people are the same and some may think the same thing. But you always need to ask multiple people so you make sure you know for sure. And just cause u asked another person dosent mean there opion is right. And say you ask for advice for some help some kids just like to joke around. So there was this one time where i really needed help with some work and i didnt know how to do it so when i went to ask all they did was joke around and tell me wrong answers. So what i did was i went to the teacher and asked him for help so when i did that he actually made me understand it so what i'm trying to say is if your friend likes to joke around when u actually need help just ask a teacher cause there gonna pay more attention then one of Ur friends will. And I had another time where I really nedded help getting my basketball form better so i tried asking my brother but he didn't help so I asked my rec basketball team so i satrted to do better in practice so thats when my coach put me as starter.

"Dear Mr. Principal,

I think that you should not require all students to participate in community service because that isn't fair to the children. It's already bad enough we have to go to school for 7 hours! Also, if children want to perform in doing community service, I think you should give them high school credits because they are doing something for the community and they deserve it for volunteering! Many kids have to do other things after school and community service is definitely not one of them. As a student, I don't agree with your suggestion and I strongly suggest you not pass that as a rule to all children because students have to do other things. For example: homework, hang out with friends, spend time with the family, etc. I know i have a busy life and I would absolutely HATE the idea of you even thinking about changing that to something a child has to do. We deserve to have the right to choose if we would like to participate in helping our community. For example, you should have us, students, vote on if we would like that or not and the people who did vote yes then they should be getting something (like a high school credit ) for there volunteering and helping our world become a better place. But for the children who don't agree, they shouldn't be forced to be performing in community service. As the principal you are, you should do the honor of letting the kids choose this time. Yes, helping the community is important but that shouldn't get in the way of the students time in there day.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME";0
"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay about distance learning for students with disabilities or who don't feel like they're good at school. I know, I know, it's like, super important and all that jazz.

So, like, first off, distance learning is like, totally flexible, you know? Like, if you have a disability or whatever, you can learn from home and on your own time. You don't have to worry about, like, getting to school on time or dealing with, like, all the noise and distractions in a traditional classroom. You can just, like, chill at home and learn whenever you feel like it.

And, like, it's not just for students with disabilities, you know? Like, if you're just not feeling super motivated or confident in your schoolwork, distance learning can be a great option. You can, like, take your time and learn at your own pace, without feeling like you're falling behind or whatever. It's like, totally stress-free, you know?

Another thing I think is cool about distance learning is that it's, like, super accessible. Like, you can use a computer or a tablet or whatever to learn, and you don't have to worry about, like, getting the right materials or equipment. You can just, like, use what you have at home, and it'll be, like, totally fine.

And, like, the best part is that distance learning can be, like, totally tailored to your needs. Like, if you're struggling with a certain subject or concept, you can, like, focus on that and learn it at your own pace. You don't have to, like, sit through a whole class and try to pay attention when you're just, like, totally lost. You can just, like, take it slow and easy and figure it out when you're ready.

So, like, yeah, distance learning is, like, totally the way to go for students who have disabilities or who just need a little extra help. It's, like, flexible, accessible, and tailored to your needs. You should, like, totally check it out, man. It's, like, totally worth it.";1
"Some schools require students to complete summer assignments over summer vacation to assure that students are still learning. These projects can take the form of summer reading, a study guide, or other means to gain background knowledge about the class. Summer projects are used to help make sure that students keep learning over the summer, and so they come to school in the fall prepared. Because summer projects are supposed to help students prepare, some question whether the projects should be designed by students or teachers in order to ensure the students learn. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because this allows for easier grading, gives students an idea of what class will be like, and actually assures that the student is learning.

Those who oppose this may say that student-designed projects allow the students to choose freely. They argue that free choice by the students will allow the student to be more interested in the topic and actually learn more. If students can freely design their own individual projects, then they may put more effort into the project and make more of an attempt to learn. While this may be true, if every student has a different project design, then it will be very difficult for teachers to grade. If the teacher designs the project then the teacher can create a rubric to easily make sure that the student actually learned over the summer.

Teacher-designed summer projects allow for easier grading, because a specific rubric can make grading easier and more equal. For example, if a high school English teacher has 30 students who all design their own project, the teacher will have to grade 30 completely different projects to see if the student learned. This may be difficult because one student may make a presentation showing a time line of specific events in a book or novel, while another student may write a research report on the usage of different parts of speech in common language. These are completely different topics and mediums of presenting information that relate to English, but the teacher will still have to grade them equally. This will be difficult for the teacher, because the projects have very little in common other than being related to English. The teacher may have a hard time giving a fair grade to students, because the projects are so different. On the other hand, if the teacher designs the project, then they can grade the projects equally and easily. Even if the project design is as simple as ""make a presentation relating to English,"" the teacher can still grade each project the same because they all have something in common other than relating to English. The teacher can then grade the projects quickly and easily to be able to move on and teach throughout the school year.

Teacher-designed summer projects show students what class will be like, because the summer project will likely be similar to assignments they will receive in class. For example, if a teacher designs the project to be a research report, students can infer that the rest of the class will be research related. This will prepare students for the class, and help students know what skills they need to improve on in order to be successful in the class. Students will be able to see what they are struggling with and have a chance to reflect and improve before the school year begins and their grade is negatively affected. For example, if a student is not as good as researching and writing research reports, they will know that they must work on researching. They will only really be able to know if the teacher designs the project. If the teacher designs the project, then they can help students learn not only the content of the class, but also the skills required to be successful in the class. This may not happen with a student-designed project because the student may not know what the class will entail and they may design an easy project, only to be surprised when the class utilizes learning techniques other than the student had practiced with their summer project.

Teacher-designed summer projects actually assure that the student is learning. For example, a math teacher may assign a packet or worksheet over the summer to show students what kind of math they will be learning in the school year and what they should already know going into the class. This allows the student to return to school prepared for a more difficult class. If the student designs their own project, they may want to work on easier subjects from past years so they do not have to think as much over the summer. They will show up to class unprepared for more difficult learning, and may struggle in the beginning of the year. The teacher knows what the students will need to learn, so the teacher should design the project. Teacher-designed projects show the student what they are up against, and force the student to learn over the summer so they are not stunned in class.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher-designed because they allow the teachers to more easily evaluate the students' work, shows the student what kinds of assignments they will recieve, and shows the student what to prepare for once school starts. Teacher-designed projects will be easier for the teacher to grade, because they can be of uniform design be graded equally. Additionally, they show students what assignments will be like and show the student if they need to work on different aspects of their work, such as research. Finally, teacher-designed projects will show students what aspects of curriculum they need to work on, such as different types of math. On their own, students may not be able to learn the curriculum or work aspects, so the teachers must design projects to help them out. When given the choice between a teacher-designed summer project and a student-designed project, choose teacher-designed in order to help the students learn and prepare. ";0
"Americans in the world are using cell phones in every hour of their lives. Cell phones allow connection with the world. However, it is now considered more fashionable to carry a phone and less about what benefits cellphones actually offer. Cell phones offer multiple characteristics (in addition to communication) including cameras, TV games, texting, music, social media etc. As a result, because cell phones offer so much more other things to do besides communication, cell phones should not be used while driving.

Cell phones are a big distraction while driving. Drivers can easily lose focus on the road and switch lanes without noticing what they are doing because their eyes are not on the road. Therefore, it is not safe for to use cell phones while driving because kids will grow into teens and think it is cool to use their phones while driving because their parents did it. There have been more accidents with teens than ever before. Phones take your attention from the road and you can endanger citizens. The greatest disadvantage of using cell phones while driving is that it distracts away from the road.

In my state of Georgia, there is a new law called the hands-free-law. The hands free law says texting while driving is banned. Also, drivers cannot use hand held devices when driving. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Since this law bans the hand-held usage of electronics devices while running a vehicle, drivers should use hands-free devices. Some hands-free device options include: blue-tooth devices and or GPS devices.

In closure, I believe that drivers should not use cell phones while driving. Using a hand-held device and driving isn't safe for the driver, other drivers, or even nearby civilians. Using a hand-held device takes more effort while driving than having a hands-free device. When driving, you should not have to multi- task. While driving you need to concentrate on the road. However, you cannot focus on the road if you're trying to use your phone at the same time.       ";0
"Should the electoral college process be demolished? Many would say no way PROPER_NAME, but I strongly consider the electoral college process should be demolished. I believe this because I think the citizens of the U.S. should be able to vote for their favored presidential candidate directly. In reality, voters are not really voting for their presidential candidate, they are voting for a slate of voters. Below are my main reasons for why I am in favor of demolishing this electoral college

First off, let's get something straight, citizens who regularly vote in the presidential election are not really voting for their desired presidential candidate. All fifty of the U.S. states are given a certain amount of electoral votes. As the electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, it's not fit for the present anymore. According to the third source, the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaing that the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winn er.

There are five reasons why the electoral college has not been demolished yet,

Certainty of outcome

Everyone's President

Swing States

Big States

Avoid Run-Off Elections these are the reasons ehy the electoral college has not been demolished even though it is highly resented in the U.S.A.

In continuation, people who vote should be able to directly vote for who they are in favor of winnning the presidency. That basically means whoever's name was checked off on their voting card should have been their pick to win the election, not for another sllate of voters who do the voting for them, that's not having a voice. The electoral college method of selecting the president may turn of potential voters for a candidatr who has no hope of carrying their state. For example, Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect.

In closing, I urge that the electoral college process should be outruled. Because people who don't support their state, their vote won't matter until this electoral college process is outruled. It is important that all Americans vote count in a election of any kind. They should be able to vote for whoever they want directly, not for electoral, but for the popular vote. Not to vote for a slate of voters who elect the president themselves. Now, again, should the electoral college process really be demolished?                                                                             ";0
"As a student growing up I've always wondered what it would be like if I could make my own summer project; instead of my teachers always making them. When it comes to summer projects, many people dispute whether or not, should students design said projects or should the teachers. If students designed their own summer projects they'd only pick what they're good at. They wouldn't pick what they struggle with, like a teacher would, so you can better yourself for the next level.

Me personally, I would say summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers pick what you need to work on to improve yourself, they actually know the curriculum and what you need to know for the following year, and they give you the work to help you; not to hurt you.

See, teachers actually know the curriculum and what they're teaching; so when they assign you these summer projects they're just trying to prepare you for the next step. When they give you all this extra work, or at least what seems like extra work, they are just doing it to prepare you for what comes next. Teachers just want to see you do better and use what you learned from them to excel at the next stage. Summer projects are used for teachers to gauge what you learned from them and to see if you can use it on ""foreign"" material that you've never seen before. They do this because they want to see you win.

Another thing for why I say that these summer projects should be teacher designed is because when create these things; they pick what you need to better yourself. Like for instance one time when I was in the 6th grade going to the 7th grade; my teacher assigned me this big summer project. Everyone else in my class didn't have to anything as big, they all got little miniature projects to do. At first I thought my teacher was doing it out of spite and hatred for me. I almost started crying, but then I asked her when school was over, why my packet was one of the biggest ones out of everyone else. She looked at me and said the only reason my packet was one of the biggest in the class was because she believed in me and I was one of the smartest kids in the class; and that I could actually complete the whole thing if I put my mind to it. I almost agreed with her but then I asked how come I can't have a smaller one and she told me I could choose if I wanted to do this one or make a smaller one for myself. I almost went along with that for a second, but then I thought about just because I could pick what I wanted to work on, would that really benefit me in the long run. After I sat and thought about that for a second I just decided to roll with bigger packet because all my teacher was trying to do was help me better myself for the next level.

The final reason for why I say teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects is because they give you the work to help you, not to hurt you. I only say this because why would a teacher intentionally give you work they know you can't do unless they know you can do it if you put your mind to it. The only reason they give out summer projects is to help you. All this extra work is used to benefit you in every way possible. I used to think it was used to just make us not be able to have a fun summer; until I actually sat down and did it and then by the time the new school year came around, I already knew all the stuff they were teaching for the first semester.

So, in conclusion when it comes to summer projects, let students tell it, they should be the ones to design it. But, all in all teachers should be the ones to design it because they do it to benefit you in the long run, they know what you'll need for the next year, and last but not least they pick what you need to become a better you. ";0
"A Good Attitude: The Key to Success

A good attitude is a vital component of success. It is often said that success is not determined by what happens to us, but rather by how we respond to it. This is especially true when it comes to our attitude. In this essay, we will explore the ways in which a good attitude can benefit a person's success, consider examples of when a good attitude has made a difference in someone's life, investigate potential negative effects of having a good attitude all the time, analyze how attitude can make or break a person's experience in school or the workplace, and explore the importance of parents teaching children why attitude matters.

Firstly, a good attitude can help a person achieve their goals and overcome obstacles. When we have a positive outlook on life, we are more likely to see opportunities where others see only challenges. This can help us stay motivated and focused on our goals. For example, a student who has a positive attitude towards learning will be more likely to seek out new challenges and take risks in the classroom. Similarly, an employee who has a positive attitude towards their job will be more likely to take on new responsibilities and go above and beyond what is expected of them.

Secondly, a good attitude can make a significant difference in someone's life. There are countless examples of people who have overcome adversity through their positive attitude. For instance, the late Steve Jobs was known for his positive attitude and his ability to see the big picture. This helped him lead Apple to great success and revolutionize the tech industry. Another example is the story of the Dalai Lama, who has faced numerous challenges throughout his life, but has always maintained a positive attitude and a deep sense of compassion for others.

However, it is important to note that having a good attitude all the time can also have negative effects. While a positive attitude can help us overcome challenges and achieve our goals, it can also make us complacent and less likely to take risks. Additionally, a good attitude can sometimes lead to a lack of self-awareness and an inability to recognize when we need to make changes in our lives. For example, a student who always has a positive attitude towards their studies may not realize that they are not studying enough and need to take a break or seek extra help.

Finally, attitude plays a crucial role in shaping our experience in school and the";1
"Cell phones have become ubiquitous in our digital age. From social media to games, these devices have revolutionized the way we communicate and interact in today's world. This makes the contentious question of whether cell phones should be allowed in the classroom an exceptionally delicate matter. On one hand, students that are allowed to use their cell phones during class may be distracted by social media, text messages, and other digital content. On the other hand, if used properly, cell phones can be powerful tools that can be used in the classroom to help students learn.

In order to make an informed decision about whether or not students should be allowed to use their cell phones during class, it is important to consider the pros and cons. One of the primary benefits of allowing cell phones in the classroom is that students can use them to enhance their learning experiences. For example, students can use their phones to research topics, watch educational videos, and take notes. In addition, some students may have audio or visual impairments that can be aided by technology.

However, there are drawbacks to allowing cell phone use in class. As mentioned, cell phones can be extremely distracting for some students. Even with appropriate warnings, one student on their phone could quickly turn into a whole class of students with their eyes glued to their screens. In addition, allowing cell phone use could open up a potential safety risk. The classroom is meant to be a learning environment, not one for inappropriate content or malicious actors.

Despite these drawbacks, allowing students to use their cell phones in class can still be beneficial. Teachers and students alike should be aware of the potential consequences that could arise from allowing cell phones in the classroom, and be proactive in creating rules and procedures to prevent these issues from occurring. With a proper understanding of the risks and rewards associated with allowing cell phone use in the classroom, teachers and administrators can make a decision that is best suited to the learning environment of their students.";1
"The face on mars is not created by aliens this is a natural landform on earth there already were landforms that were created. We can't say aliens made those too. Such as vocanoes, rivers, and mountains we also couldn't say we built those because we didn't. If aliens really did build the face on mars how come their isn't any proof anything was on the planet? If there was any form of a living species you would have at least seen Egyptian- style pyramids or even small shacks.

Mars is a planet that is know for having rocks on it, there is a possibility that this is just a huge rock that was carved into the planet already or the planet it's self got either hit by and astroid or had been forming it's self in some way. Aliens could'nt have build the face they would've needed soem short of unground passege or even shelter's, none of these things were found when we discoverd the face. We get the picture looks blurry btu even with zooming in you can't see any such thing as if there was an alien.

Scientist has studied the photos the astronots had brought home we saw their were may rocks this could have been a mistake. How would an alien know what a human face looks like anyways? By our understand we could be looking at it and imageing it's a face when really it's just a rock that was formed to look like a humans head.

April 5, 1998 when mars Global Surveyor flew oven the face he snapped pictures ten times sharper then the original Viking photos. Thousands of people anxious to have the photo appear on JPL web site by yet still came out with saying that it was just an natural landform. People were not satisfied, this bring's me back to the point were it was just our imagination maybe we're lookingat it wrong it's really meant to look like one thing but were making it look like another.

We belive that if aliens really did make this face how come their wasn't any type of form in which we can tell their was any type of life form living on mars? Landscapes are usual to see on planest and this was one of them. If there was any type of life form i think Michale Malin would have already taken pictures of them if he had seen anything. He didn't which means this face was actually a natural landform.      ";0
"Staying occupied has a number of benefits, from increased mental health to greater overall satisfaction with life. Studies have consistently shown that proactively completing tasks is more beneficial than procrastinating or being inactive. Higher productivity leads to better goal achievement and overall success. 

Case studies of teenagers have revealed that staying occupied and productive can help lead to successful goal achievement. For example, Laura, a high school senior, set an ambitious goal to be accepted into her first-choice college. She stayed motivated and productive throughout the application process and was ultimately accepted into her dream school. 

Alternatively, David, a college freshman, struggled to stay productive and inactive lifestyle kept him from achieving his goals. David was barely passing his classes and, as a result, his future career plans were delayed.

These two cases illustrate the key differences between staying occupied and being inactive. Staying occupied is essential for goal achievement, while being inactive can have a negative impact on life ambitions.";1

"Doing your best is an important part of life. It's not just about getting good grades or obtaining a job—it's about having the satisfaction of knowing that you have reached your full potential. When you do your best, you can be proud of your achievements and use them as a stepping stone to greater success or happiness in the future. Additionally, trying to reach your peak performance has a positive effect on your mental and physical health.

When you do your best, you are using all of the tools available to you. This includes developing creative problem solving skills and learning to use the resources available to you to complete a task. You are also learning to experiment and take risks in order to reach your goal. This process helps you build self-confidence, as you are confident that you are doing the best that you can.

Finally, it is important to always do your best, because it sets an example for others and helps to create a positive work ethic. It is inspiring to watch someone put in maximum effort and achieve great success. When you put your best foot forward, you are leading by example and showing others what it means to strive for greatness. All of these benefits come together to make a strong argument for why you should always make an effort to do your best.";1
"Students all around the world have to cope with the anxiety and stress that comes with going to school. Part of the reason why is because of the environment the students have to be in. Some people simply cannot work well while sitting in a classroom for seven hours a day, five days a week. However, they are required to graduate and receive their diploma so they can get into a good college and have a good life. This does not mean they have to go to a building every day to learn and then come home and stress over their homework. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because it is a more relaxing environment for them, they will have more free time to get their work done, and it will increase the well-being of their mental health.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they are able to work in a better environment. The environment of public school buildings can be too much for some students. They are required to sit in uncomfortable chairs in a cinder-block classroom listening to lectures that can sometimes go too fast, and on top of that, they have to balance 7 classes of homework every night which eats away large amounts of their day. While it may be better for students to receive in-person instruction so they can learn the material better, it is not worth the workload they have to deal with, and if they need help, there are virtual teachers who can help or they have the ability to ask someone for help at home. If they are able to work from home, they can be in a soothing and comforting setting and clear their mind because they are home, which can increase brain productivity which will make them have better grades. Another example of attending in-person classes being a bad environment is the social stress that comes with being in high school. Having to balance both a social life and an academic life can be too much for one person, which is why it would be better to take out the social aspect of the equation and focus on having an academic career.

Another reason why attending classes at home would benefit students is because they would have much more time to actually get their work done and raise their GPA. Attending school in person for seven hours straight and then going home and only having 4 hours to complete all the homework given to them is not enough time for students to decompress when they come finish their day. On top of that, many teenagers have part-time jobs so that is another 6-7 hours not spent of getting schoolwork done. If students were able to take classes at home, they would space out and manage their time so it works best for their schedule, which is overall the smartest choice a student can make.

One final reasons why students should take classes at home is because it will increase their overall well-being and mental health. Aside from trying to keep up with academics, going to high school also comes with the stress of having a good social life. Teenagers all around the world are constantly trying to fit in with their peers and worry about their social life, which a lot of times affects their schoolwork because they prioritize their social life over their academic life. Students today are more worried about having a lot of followers on social media rather than raising their GPA and taking Advanced Placement classes. Depression and suicide rates are so high in teenagers because of how they get treated by their peers at high school. One of the main causes of suicide in teens is because they are being bullied, and bullying would decrease drastically if they took their classes from home. This is how it would better their mental health and overall well-being.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they are able to work in a much more comfortable environment, they can have more free time to get all of their work done, and it will positively increase their mental health and overall well-being. ";0
"I believe the summer project should be student-designed because every student learns differently from another, it will express students creativity and originality, it will make it more enjoyable for students.

The student-designed summer projects will show how every student learns differently from another. Their are many ways to learn information. Student's can learn information through watching a video, reading, or even experiencing it in real life. After gathering their information, students can make a poster, a presentation, a news article, a website, or even write a song about it. The students will show the teacher the best way they learn through their choice in the project.

The summer project will also express students creativity and originality. Students creativity comes from their imaginations. Their imagination is filled with their interests and the things they are passionate about. For an example, I'm really passionate about dance and I want to learn more about the history of dance. I will make a project on the history of dance. I will use the information I already know about the subject and research more information. Every student 's project will be original and creative in their own way because everyone has different interest and ideas.

Summer break is a time for students and teachers to have fun with family, friends, and to go on vacation. They won't be thinking about school. The summer project is a great way for students to continue learning during the summer. It will be more enjoyable for students to pick the idea and the way they present it. I think this will have more students participate in the assignment and be eager to learn during the summer.

The teacher-designed summer project is also a good idea because it makes it easier for the teacher to grade the same project. It will also make it easier for students to know what their idea is and how they are going to present the project.

Over all, I think the student-designed summer project will be a great way for students to learn and present something they are passionate about through a creative way.  ";0
"Limiting car usage has a lot of advantages in everyday life. Cars are the one destroying the planet. When the cars' smoke gets to the atmosphere, the atmosphere gets destroyed by it. If we destroy the atmosphere then what or who is going to take care of our planet from the powerful sunlight. Also limiting cars may also save you a lot of money. Think about all the money we spend on gas for cars, we can do a lot better for the world with all that money.

Now I'm going to talk about some evidence in the article that makes limiting car usage better for life. In source 1 ""In German Suburb, Life Goes Without Cars"", Heidrum Walter, a citizen from Vauban said that she lives happier without cars because when she had a car she was always tense (paragraph 3). Now in sourse 2 the article says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer of air to trap car emissions(paragraph 15), and that is really bad. Also in source 2 again the last paragraph says that the smog cleared when they banned the usage of cars.

In source 3 paragraph 24 Carlos Arturo a businessman from Bogota, Colombia said when Bogota's streets were car-free that it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. At last, source 4 says that now that there is less driving, safety in the cities have improved.

So I say that we must limit car usage because of all the things i mensioned in the previous paragraphs. The city will be safer, the planet will be safer and everything will be better.            ";0
"People who drive while texting or on a call put themselves and others in danger while being distracted by the phones.

It is very dangerous and irresponsible for people to be on their phones while driving. It always causes and accident which leads to death, laws being broken and innocent people having to suffer the consequences of others. Texting while driving will always be dangerous to everyone involved making it a hazard to anyone.

When people start to text or call their focus starts to drift away from driving and keeping an eye on the road. When driving you must keep focus on the road and making sure you do not run into anything or anyone. But once you start to text someone else or talking on the phone you start to become more involved with the phone instead of the road. That is when accidents start to accrue and people begin to get hurt. Many people have been victims of people who are on the phone texting instead of watching where they were driving. There has been Multiple of people, families who have been hurt or even killed due to people texting while driving. Not only do the people who get hit get hurt most drives also die as well in the accident because it was so intense and horrible. This is such a huge cause of why it is so dangerous to use your phones while driving. It takes so much risk to do it because ne second you could just be sending one little text then in less than a second your about to drive into oncoming traffic. Many people who are just walking the streets or driving home suffer due to people on their phones while having one eye on the road.

Because there have been so many incidents where people get hurt due to texting while driving that laws have and still being made to stop this. Many states one by one have all agreed that people on their phones while driving must come to an end. Laws are said that it is not allowed to use your phone while driving. The consequence or doing this can lead people to be pulled over and even arrested. There is still a good amount of states that still let you use your phones while driving but, the increase of the laws of being made for that is going up fast. There has just been so many problems and accidents that people and the states are starting to really make a change with those laws. It is taken very seriously due to so many people taking action and protesting this being put to creation. Not listing to the states that have up that law can cause major problems for people. It is a very serious issue that is trying to be controlled and stopped.

Even though people do die every day due to problem there are some who do live but affected by it for the rest of their lives. When some people are hit by a car it may not kill them but it may permanently damage their bodies. Many people have been left to use a wheelchair the rest of their lives because of the car crash. There have been cases that some victims have been left in comas because of how hard the car hit them. These are all the causes of what could and what have happened to people who have been a victim of people driving while on the phone. Plus, the families and friends that have to deal with the loss of a loved one. Everyone gets hurt that is involved with this kind of accident. It affects everyone you do not have to dead for that. It kills people it leaves people broken, and it just leads to pain. All of this is due to people using their phones when they are supposed to be focused driving looking at what is in front of them.

All of these reasons are why people support the laws saying people should not use their phones while driving. It is beyond dangerous for everyone, it should not be allowed and should be stopped. It affects everyone whether you are the driver or the victim or even the family. It hurts everyone involved and that is why there are many laws being made to stop any more accidents to happen. Using your phone while driving will never be safe no matter what someone does or says. It is always going to put yourself and other in harm ways.                                           ";0
I don't agree with changing it because sometimes students cant help that they don't have a B average or higher in all their classes. Teachers are a big thing that helps you in a class or tears you down in a class. If you don't understand the teacher or don't understand the class or even don't get along with the teacher then that can change the way you work and act in the class. You could only be missing a B by 1 or 2 points and that means you cant play any sports until that is a B average and sports are important for some kids. I believe it should be determined by your homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Sports are important to some kids and all but they have to be abill to do good in class as wail as in there chosen sport. In personal reference i am pushed to do good in school and i am unable to do sports until i bring my grades or grade to a passing average. That's one of my family's rules no sports if there is not all passing grades on report card. I personally know many students that live to play sports and come to school to play sports and they try their hardest in class but don't always achieve their goals in the classroom so that means they cant play. That's why i believe it should be averaged on homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Other family's might think differently about it than i do but this is how i feel about being abill to play sports as long as you are doing well in all of your classes.;0
"Cultivating and maintaining a positive attitude is essential for both personal and professional success. A positive attitude can help individuals overcome challenges, achieve their goals, and improve their overall well-being. In this essay, I will discuss three reasons why people should strive for a positive attitude and provide relevant examples for each point.

Firstly, a positive attitude can help individuals overcome challenges and obstacles in their personal lives. When faced with difficult situations, people with a positive attitude are more likely to approach the problem with optimism and resilience. For example, a person with a positive attitude may view a failed exam as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than as a failure. This mindset can lead to a more productive and effective approach to problem-solving. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals cope with stress and anxiety, as they are more likely to focus on solutions rather than dwelling on negative thoughts.

Secondly, a positive attitude can benefit individuals in their professional lives. People with a positive attitude are more likely to be motivated, productive, and effective in their work. They tend to have a can-do attitude, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and better performance. For example, a salesperson with a positive attitude may be more likely to close deals, as they are more confident and enthusiastic about their product. Similarly, a manager with a positive attitude may be more effective in leading their team, as they are more likely to inspire and motivate their employees.

Finally, a positive attitude can improve overall well-being and happiness. People with a positive attitude tend to have better relationships, as they are more likely to be empathetic, compassionate, and supportive of others. They also tend to have a greater sense of purpose and meaning in life, as they are more likely to focus on the positive aspects of their existence. For example, a person with a positive attitude may be more likely to volunteer their time and resources to help others, as they are more aware of the impact they can have on the world.

In conclusion, cultivating and maintaining a positive attitude is essential for personal and professional success. A positive attitude can help individuals overcome challenges, achieve their goals, and improve their overall well-being. By focusing on solutions rather than dwelling on negative thoughts, people can lead more productive and fulfilling lives. Therefore, it is important for individuals to strive for a positive attitude and to make";1
"From Luke's experieance he know's that he is lucky to life in america. And that other people in other countires don't get a chance to live a good life. So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever! We are very lucky to live in the USA becuase we have many more oppertunities the anyone else does.      ";0
"Proving The Face is Just a Natural Landform.

Although this face was unexpected,that doesn't nessasarily define that the face has anything to do with aliens. There are majority of theories we can assume from this topic. Few scientist condoned that this mysterious face had something to do with a very unordinary prediction .Some scientist seemed surprised when they saw the photograph of the face on mars.

As a scientist, many mistakes are made during observations, but that's apart of human life. Mistakes are casual in everyday life and, all of us make them. In my opinion, I don't think this entertaining outbreak had anything to do with aliens. In fact, they're wasn't a specific sign, or clue that an alien was actually was involved. NASA got a great shot at the face, and the picture closely showed that their was nothing do be deeply concerned about.

The face was defineitly rare, but over the years the face continues to fade so it shouldn't be harmful. If it happened to really be an alien, we would know from the recordings, and pictures that were captured. This is a huge topic to discuss, and space can likely be considered as a horrifying setting due to rumors, and scientific observations. Astrounaunts never discovered any issues, or new assumptions by traveling to space.

The main point is aliens aren't realistic, you may see them in movies, books, or perhaps may hear about them. An alien was never discovered by NASA, and the face just appeared to be a natural cause. The face could of been anything, but we know it wasn't an alien because there is no proof that the face was an alien, and still isn't as we speak.

In conclusion, think about other things that are possible.                                                                                 ";0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage.  It is better for the environment, it limits time spent sitting in traffic, and saves money.

The main cause of people wanting to limit driving is to protect the environment.  According to an article by Elizabeth Rosenthal, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gasses in Europe... and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States.""  Emissions from car exhaust is polluting the air and creating smog in large cities.  According to Robert Duffer, Paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog.  Some people want new suburbs to be built specifically to encourage the limiting of driving.  Limiting driving does lower the amout of smog and air pollution in cities.

Another benefit of limiting driving is that it limits time spent sitting in traffic.  In Bogota, Colombia, a ""car-free day"" was issued.  The goal was to reduce smog as well as reduce traffic jams around the city.  The reduction of these traffic jams also reduced stress and promoted excersize.  People could stop worrying about being late for work because of the traffic.  It caused many people to walk or bike to work instead of driving or taking the bus.  Another advantage of this is that parks and sports centers have thrived across Bogota.  Limiting the use of cars isn't only healthier for the environment but also for us.

One final advantage to limiting the use of cars is that it saves money.  Citizens save money by not having to buy cars or the gas they require.  Also, citizens don't have to pay taxes for roads, parking lots, or traffic lights.  Another way limiting driving saves money is on the materials and equipment needed to pave roads and parking lots.  Since many people who live in dense cities take the subway or bus to work anyway because of the recent recession, limiting car use would be an easy way to clean up some pollution in that city.

In conclusion, limiting driving has many big advantages. It protects the environment while limiting traffic in cities, encouraging excersize, and saving money.  I'm not sure how it would work out here because of how spread out everything is, but it sounds like a great idea in a dense city.    ";0
"It would be awsome to identify human emotions,and knowing what students feel in class can be really useful.

I think the new technology that reads emotional expressions of people can be useful in schools. The teachers will be able to know when the students are bored, in the article it said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" it let's the teacher know by the students emotions that the lesson is boring or the lesson is not understandable for them. The new technology can help teachers make their plan lessons more fun and understandable and if the schools of all around the world uses the new technology it would be lot easier for the teachers to make the students be more focus on school and the lesson, but not only the technology can help schools it can also help people with their business, but that's not the point the point is that school's should start using the new the technology to help students stay in school and helped them to stay focus. But not only it helps during class time it can also help outside of school like if the student's play sports the coches can know when the student is sad, tired, happy,or angry. So I think having the new technology in school can be really helpful and useful for everyone but most likely the teacher's.";0
"Do you belive the image of the face on Mars was created by aliens, or is just a natural landform? Well I belive it is just a natural landform.

Its obvius that cameras back in 1976 werent as sharp or as modern as they are today. Evidence from the passage show that in Sept 1997, NASA went to take a photo of the alleged face on Mars."" On April 5th, 1998, when MGs flew over Cydonia, Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original viking photos.""

Not everyone agreed with the picture that was tooken. Because the photo was tooken in April'98, which was a cloudy time of year for Mars, people suggested alien markings were hidden by haze. Though this theory makes sense ,Mission controllers prepared to look again.

On april 8th, 2001, a cloudless summer day on the red planet in Cydonia, MGS drew a close enough for a second look.

Malin's team captured a excellent image using the cameras maximum resolution. A pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters in the best 1976 viking photo. This means that the camera used is much more sharp and see's further than the previous camera. This evidence is the reason I believe there is no camera flaw and is just a natural landform.

Also the picture in april of 2001 shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, in other words common landforms around the American west.

With this evidence there is no way there could have been a mistake in the picture. Also there could be no theory because the picture was tookin on a cloudless summer day.        ";0
"Throughout my life, I have wondered what it would feel like to complete school from home. When I first began school, I wanted to stay at home and do school work or not work at all. This idea seems to be popular among young children. However, as I grow older and mature, I better understand why attending class physically is detrimental to a successful future. Distance learning can prohibit students from gaining important social skills needed for life, support student laziness, and even make cheating more accessible to students. For these reasons, I believe that school should be taught primarily in person.

To begin, distance learning can prohibit students from gaining the important social skills they need in order to flourish outside of school. For example, when a child learns online, they do not have to go in public or make friends. This causes a lack of social skills. Studies show that children who are taught by distance learning are more likely to develop social anxiety and lack public speaking skills. Secondly, when children learn solely off a computer, they do not develop the same respect that they would for a teacher or their peers. A child I know who is attending distance learning classes severely lacks needed social skills and suffers from anger issues. Although he can be sweet, he often loses his temper and often becomes physical with whoever he is angry at. I believe this is due to distance learning. Without learning these important skills, children often suffer outside of school and in the real world.

Moreover, students often become lazy when they no longer have to wake up and get ready for school. Although some students work wonderfully without this motivation, others may develop bad habits. Some of these bad habits can include, sleeping in too late, not finishing work on time, and never getting out of their house. A beneficial way to prevent these habits is obtaining a job or attending a few classes at a physical school throughout the week. I believe that students should be required to attend at least some physical school in order to prevent this from occurring.

Furthermore, when teachers cannot monitor students, cheating is more likely to occur. Students can easily get away with cheating on tests or exams when they are not proctored by a teacher. This cheating can also occur on other assignments. When attending physical school, teachers may take up phones and clear students' desks in order to prevent cheating. This can not be done while a student learns from home. Having students take their tests in a physical school could help prevent these acts. While some students may be honest, it would be extremely easy for others to lie and cheat.

Although I believe school should be primarily taught in person, there can be many benefits for a student taking online classes. Some students learn much better when they are not in an environment in which they feel vulnerable. For example, children with autism often break down because they feel like they are being watched and judged by their peers. These children would most definitely benefit from distance learning and it should be an option for people who already struggle with being in public. However, in most other circumstances, distance learning would negatively affect the student.

In conclusion, I believe that distance learning would, in general, negatively affect the school system. Although there are a few benefits to this new concept, I thoroughly believe that there would be many more negative consequences for students. Being able to make friends in school is extremely important and should be prioritized over students making online friends. After understanding all of the negative affects that can occur due to distance learning, I believe students need to be taught at least half of their classes in public. Doing so can prevent many negative affects attached to distance learning. ";0
"Distance learning is either a choice or a options to many school. would it benefit? or are there other ways to attend classes differently? Some people believe that schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home while others believe other options would be a better choice for students to attend classes. This is important because distance learning is a better option for students to attend class from home. Distance learning is the best option for students because it would allow more time to do other things at home, secure the safety for the student, and having more comfort to stay at home.

First, distance learning is important to students because it would allow more time to do other things at home. Students would need to finish up many work to be done at home, so learning distance would be a useful option for students to have important things to do at home. An example, students with chores, part time jobs, and personal projects are essential to the students life at home, since most of their important focus are usually at home by their. So for students to do classes at home by online, it would benefit their lives being more easy to handle and have more free time to themselves. This would allow a student to finish their classwork and homework on time to be done, and moved on doing other subjects at home such as mowing the grass, cleaning the house, or finishing their part time job. Therefore, distance learning would be a best idea for students to work at home because it would allow more time to be done and complete many of their work at home.

Also, distance learning would be a best option for students because it would keep them secure and safe at home. Many students are afraid of going to school because they might either get hurt or catch a illness by any students. To illustrate, students may catch a sickness from another students, either by coughing or touching them by accidents. Many are usually getting sick that way because most never wash their hands or get check up by a doctor which is why students can be easily get an infection. Distance learning would prevent any students to be sick because it would handle the spreading by teaching their classes online rather than at school. The amount of students and teachers being sick would keep them and everyone safe from contracting a infection by not interacting them in social, but rather online where the teacher can be speaking from a distance, long communication. Some schools has use distance learning as a way to prevent anyone getting a infection during the corona virus spread. This would decrease the amount of infections in school to not declare a quarantine to happen in school because it would interrupt the class lesson and prevent any students to learn. Thus, distance learning would be a best option for students because it would keep the students more secure and safe from a pandemic to happen in school.

However, not everyone agree on this position. Some believe that a better options for students would be benefit to them because it would gain more reliable and comfort for them to work at this rate. Nevertheless, the individuals overlook a key idea that is distance learning which would provide the student to have comfort at home than school. An example, many students has always been more comfortable at home, whether it would be sleeping early or eating more of their own choices. This would make the students more easy to behave at home because it would relate to their environment at home more than at school which would also prevent any interruption in classes. Students with anxiety or disabilities would likely to be at home with a parent or guardian, since parents are a way to bring a sense of comfort and care to the students. For this reason, students would likely choose to use distance learning because staying at home would be more comfortable to them than at school which can give them a better way to listen and learn online.

With all this claim, one must conclude that distance learning is a better option to attend class at home. In other words, distance learning is a better option for students to attend class at home because it would allow more time for the student to do other things, giving security to the student safety, and making the student feel more comfortable at home. Distance learning would still benefit as the same idea for school, namely being the fact students can still be educated online with Google classroom being a better choice for them to work on homework and classwork more timely together. This would make the students and teachers more educated well than at school. Attended classes at home is a best way for anyone to choose distance learning in their path of a better future. ";0
"Should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle?

For a while now since the early 2000s cell phones/smartphones has been a technological rise in the use of its kind. People use them daily for things like social media, internet surfing, reading, planning, alarms and more. There are many ways that the handheld ""easy to use"" technology can help people, but they also can be dangerous to us in many ways if we don't take fully responsibility in them and use them when we need them and when we don't. This leads to the harm of people who think they can be using their phones while they are driving.

Driving can be at times boring but using something to distract you from the focus of your own safety on the road isn't a good choice. They are plenty of reason why using cell phones while driving is bad. The most brutal things can happen while you're looking away just for a second. In my opinion the most brutal things that can happen while you're distracting yourself from driving is you killing yourself or someone else. The worst part about it is that you'll always remember what you've done just by your careless actions.

Most people would say it's not as dangerous or that if you're good at it then you can use your phone while you drive. That's not true at all because driving takes in a lot of focus and concentration in order to be a successful driver. Also, when you ARE driving you really must drive for yourself and everyone else because even though you're paying attention it doesn't mean everyone else is. It takes more than just the push of a pedal and the turn of a wheel. In my opinion while you're driving you should be at your most caution due to the risk and the things that could happen to you and anyone else.

Daily people end up either dead or injured badly due to the simple fact of a device that they should have mot being paying attention to. Since the handheld device has been put out it has caused thousands of deaths each year. In 2014 cell phones caused over 26 percent of the car incidents in the U.S. last year there where 1.5 million car incidents due to cell phones being involvement while driving. And of those incidents 58% of the drivers were teens. The rate of incident is increasing annually making driving even more difficult and complex then it already is.

So, the best thing to do is to just not handle a phone in anyway when you're driving. There are enough incidents already worldwide due to cell phone being a distraction for drivers. If you have an urge to pick up a phone or get texts or calls often while you're driving it'll be safer to just turn your phone off until you're in a safe position where you can handle it without any risk. Driving is something that should be done with seriousness and not to be tempted with. The roads would be safer and people would be safer if they start turning their phones off for a better solution to deaths by car crashes.

Should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle                                 ";0
"Dear Florida Senator,

The Electoral College has been in the United States for a very long time. It has worked for the most part and we have been happy with it for the most part, but ""for the most part,"" doesn't cut it. The system has to be one that works all the time without fail. Said system has to make sense. That is why electing by the popular vote should be our's.

Except for two states, the electoral votes are, ""Winner take all."" This means that if the  popular vote is obtained in a state by just a smidge, the the entire state's votes go to that candidtate. This makes absolutely no sense at all. The ""big states"" like California, Texas, and Florida have about thirty to fifty five electoral votes unlike most other states which have three to ten electoral votes. If the ""big states"" were to be won by a little by one  candidate, then he or she would have over one hundred votes toward his or her candidacy but only about sixty percent of the popularity for those states. This happened to Al Gore in 2000 against George W. Bush.

Another problem with the Electoral College is that the creators did not make it so that a tie is impossible. Richard A. Posner explains in his article from

Slate Magazine that although the total number of electoral college votes is even, it is still very unlikely. Now which is more likely, something to happen out of 580 things or something to happen out of many million?

When voting for the president, the voter feels like he or she has the power to choose our nation's leader. When the voter realizes they are not voting for the president, they are, in fact, electing chosen people to vote for them, it does not really have the same effect.  This is explained in Bradford Plumer's ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" Electing by the popular vote would make it seem more personal and voting would have more meaning.

Richard A. Posner also said that the Electoral College made candidates go to more than one region of the United States to gain support. In fact, they just go to swing states and states they know they will win. Electing by the poplular vote would make candidates go to every state to gain support.

The Electoral College may or may not have worked before, but it just doesn't now. It will take a while to implement the process of electing by popular vote, but when we do, it will definitely be worth it.

"Online Schooling vs. Traditional Schooling: A Debate

As an 8th grader, I have had the opportunity to experience both online schooling and traditional in-person schooling. While both methods have their pros and cons, I believe that online schooling is the way of the future. In this essay, I will argue that online schooling provides more flexibility and personalization, while also offering different ways for students to receive the help they need. However, I also acknowledge that online schooling can have its drawbacks, such as struggling to understand the material or forgetting assignments due to lack of reminders.

One of the biggest advantages of online schooling is the flexibility it provides. With online classes, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where access to traditional schools is limited. Online schooling also allows for more personalization, as teachers can tailor the material to each student's needs and learning style. This can lead to a more effective learning experience and better academic performance.

Another benefit of online schooling is the different ways students can receive help. With traditional in-person schooling, students may struggle to get the help they need, especially if they are shy or have difficulty asking questions. However, with online schooling, students can receive help through various means, such as online tutoring, discussion forums, and virtual office hours. These resources provide students with additional support and can help them stay on track with their coursework.

Despite the many benefits of online schooling, there are also potential problems that students may experience. One of the main concerns is struggling to understand the material. Without the face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers, students may find it harder to grasp complex concepts or ask for help when they need it. Additionally, students may forget assignments or miss deadlines due to a lack of reminders or organization tools.

However, I believe that these problems can be mitigated with proper planning and implementation. For example, teachers can use multimedia tools to provide interactive and engaging lessons, and parents can help their children stay organized and motivated. Additionally, online schooling platforms can provide built-in reminders and organization tools to help students stay on track.";1
"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand the benefits of continuing to learn new skills and information. Learning new things helps us to develop our expertise and expand our knowledge. It also helps us to stay current with the latest advancements in our fields and to remain competitive in the workforce.

One quote that emphasizes the importance of continuing to learn is by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote suggests that we should not simply follow the path that others have taken, but rather forge our own path and create our own opportunities. By continuing to learn and develop our skills, we can do just that.

An example of people learning new skills and knowledge can be seen in the field of technology. Every day, new software and tools are being developed that make our lives easier and more efficient. People in this field must continue to learn and adapt in order to stay current and remain competitive.

Education is also an important aspect of discovering what we are truly passionate about. By taking classes and exploring different subjects, we can find out what interests us and what we are good at. This can help us to make informed decisions about our future and to pursue careers that we are truly passionate about.

Finally, it is important to push ourselves further despite already achieving success. By continuing to learn and develop our skills, we can become even better at what we do and achieve even greater success. Whether it's in our personal lives or in our careers, pushing ourselves further can lead to new opportunities and a greater sense of fulfillment.

In conclusion, continuing to learn new skills and information is crucial for personal and professional growth. By developing our expertise and expanding our knowledge, we can stay current with the latest advancements and remain competitive in the workforce. Education is also an important aspect of discovering what we are truly passionate about, and pushing ourselves further can lead to new opportunities and a greater sense of fulfillment.";1
"Some students rather attend school from home, but personally, it's notably more beneficial to attend classes from school. It is too big of a responsibility for students to wake up in their very own home and do their work and assignments. Also, It's much more interactive and reliable to be in the school enviornment. It's also much easier to achieve higher grades and expand on learning abilities.

The responsibility of having students wake up early in the morning and learn is enormous. Having to do work from the household is easily distracting to the students. They are surrounded by games, and devices that are not obtainable at school. There is a different mentality of being in a home rather a place built around learning. When at home, students are not used to spending hours upon hours learning and doing their assignments, and when bored or tired have easy access to avoiding their work and abandoning their tasks. Simply going for a drink of water or gaining easy access of electronic use with no monitorization is time subtracted from the required learning.

The enviorment of school is built around thorough plans of keeping students engaged and learning. In school, there is supervision, enforcement by the teachers and administration given to the students to do their work. Not only are students encouraged to do their work in school, but they're given more opportunities to learn their subjects and material. Students having assistance and guidance from their teachers, staff, and peers is beneficial to them because it gives them the chance of asking questions and having one on one help that's not given over a digital screen. This help leads to better grade results and better performance by the student.

There is much more than just learning that students benefit from attending a school rather their home. They're introduced to new people. Students develop social skills and bonds that they don't even know about. . There are many cases of homeschooled students who complain in the future on how awkward they are when they speak to new people, or how they interact with others. Having the chance to socialize with those nearby, speaking with them , and experiencing events with them eliminates this problem and leads to skills and relationships in the future. Attending schools sets up students for the future in not just academic or educational ways.

It's important that students are not secluded from the outside world in the future and have the chance to strive for success. Rather being in the confined, comfort of their own home, students are given more opportunities and a chance at a better life. It's concluded that schools are more beneficial to a students overall success.        ";0

So when you asked me if Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers My anwser will still my no because there are still thing on Venus we don know about. And even though scientist are trying to take new egimpment up tho Venus it still going to be tough to still figure out what still up their in Venous.   ";0
"Dearest Principal,

Many students throughout our country now play sports.

They are free to participate in any kind of sports they prefer. Some of the schools don't agree with the fact the students need a B average. That is why so many of the students in this school don't agree that we should really need a B average to play sports.

It's been going around the school that our grades are not perfect enough to participate in activity. Some students in the school may not have a B average, but that does not mean they shouldn't play sports. The reasons could be that they speak another language, like Spanish or French an may not fully understand us so well. It can also be to the fact that some kids come from different type of background family such as religion and can not study what we are leaning. Even kids that are a bit slow in learning or mentally can have a few problems with studying their objects.

Other reasons could possibly be the fact that the teachers don't quietly go slow enough to make sure that the students do not fall behind. Another reason for students to not have a B average in their score could be because of their leaning disabilities, like autism or dyslexia. I personally play sports like soccer an softball, even outside of school, and I enjoy them and It's a way to spend more time with friends. And if I study hard enough, i might be able to go to college in the future an get a good career. It's not because some students don't want to do the work, It's the problems that go around their";0
"Dear, Principal

I think students should be required to perform community service. So we can make this world better by cleaning up litter. The most important is teaching kids how to learn. helping them do better in class. We can make students become smarter. Teach them what they need to know. Teach them from wrong to good. They need the education that they are giving. To actually become something in the world. LITTERING! Is everywhere. Papers are on the ground. They throw there trash on the ground like if someone is going to pick it up. So is good that community service make them pick up trash. So they can keep the ground clean. So those who think its important it is. Some people don't have respect for the world they live in. Those who think is bad i guess they like living in a dirty place. But that is a great way to help world. Helping people clean up the streets. Sidewalks that people walk on. Doing the best for are community. So i will like to help do my community service. THANK YOU!!

"No Cellphones While Driving

I think cell phones should be banned while driving. The use of cellphones while driving can cause many accidents. Most states already have a law that prohibits the use of cellphones while driving. Car accidents are the leading cause of deaths for teenagers. Another reason they should be banned is because of the rise in ones insurance.

Many beginning drivers are the ones who are most likely to text and drive. They feel like they are free and feel they look cool with their phones out while behind the wheel. Not only teenagers, but anyone can be talking on the phone and get distracted and cause an accident. The use of cellphones is the leading cause of many accidents.

Due to the high rate of accidents, insurance is very expensive. Insurance is extremely high for teenagers because they are the ones who tend to cause more accidents. Personally, I have almost hit many cars because I was distracted by a text message or a phone call. Since the economy and world is very different now, money is very tight. Let's face it, nobody wants to pay a high amount or even pay with their life just to check one message.

Not only do you have to watch for cars, but for pedestrians as well. If you are in a crowded area, or somewhere near many sidewalks, avoid your phone. Anyone can be crossing the road at anytime and since the person is not paying attention to the road, there can be a very deadly accident. Hitting a pedestrian is probably the worst thing you could do. There are now new apps on cell phones that will let others know you are on the road.

Therefore, do not text and drive. Being distracted on your phone can cause many accidents. You can hit a car, make others crash, or even worse, hit a pedestrian while they're crossing the road. Cell phones should be banned when driving.              ";0
"Dear principal,

I think that you should allow phones at school as long as they are off during class. That way, we wouldn't have to keep our phones in our school bags all day. We would be able to carry them around in school. There could be some pros to this, and some cons to this. Some pros could be this: if something went wrong at school, or someone got hurt, we would be able to call our parents and tell them what happened. Or say we forgot something at home, we would be able to text our parents to ask them if they would be able to bring us what we have forgotten. In that way, cell phones would be a very useful thing to have.

Some cons could be that some students might not listen to these rules and have them on during class. Or besides just having them on, they may text people or play games on their phones. Students could also use cell phones as a way to cheat on tests. They could text each other the answers. Teachers would just have to trust us that we wouldn't cheat on something. Or that we would have our phones off during class time. I guess there really is no way to tell if we have our phones off during class time. If a student is caught doing something with a cell phone during class time, the cell phone should be confiscated until the end of the school day when the student can come and pick up his/her cell phone. If they continue to use their cell phone during class time, they should get a detention for violating school policy, or something along those lines.

I think that cell phone restrictions in school should be let up just a little so we would be at least able to play a game at lunch, or ask a friend a question in a free period. It would be nice for us students if the school would kindly let us. I think all of the students at the school would very much appreciate it. We would all be very great full if you followed through with this policy. All of the students I'm sure would obey the rules and be happy that we would be able to use our cell phones during lunch periods, or free periods. Thank you very much for taking the time out the read my letter. I hope that you have taken in to consideration what I have said.                  ";0
"Often times, when someone wants advice, they go to multiple sources. Seeking many opinions can help someone make a better choice. There's no question why, for they just want to make sure they're doing the right thing. Other voices in a situation can prove to be beneficial, but why?

It's great to get multiple opinions when you need help. The people you go to can give you different viewpoints, so you have all the possible solutions. In asking others for help, it expands your knowledge, growing your mind so you are able to fix the problem. For example, I had an issue with my friends the other day. Feeling distraught, I went to my siblings for help, knowing that they have had the same problem when they were my age. Once they told me how to fix it, I was able to use that knowledge on other siuations.

In a recent survey, 2 out of every 5 middle schoolers don't know who to go to for advice. This can be detrimental, as they never get help on the situation. It depends on the issue that they are having, but the best people to go to are the ones closest to them. In a situation like friend problems, it may be best to go to a parent or a relative. If you are having trouble in school or sports, you could ask a teacher or coach, for they would be happy to help. A friend could help you out if you had a hard decision to make on whether you should take a class or not. The people closest to you are the best advice givers you can get.

On the other hand, many people think that advice isn't good. When asking others for help, they may argue that their opinion is best. When in fact, it's best to get multiple sources. No one piece of information is the greatest. Others think that it can get confusing to remember everything and apply it to your siutation. In the long run, if the advice given doesn't help, take your own opinion, not theirs. It's all about your descision.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. The advice they get will help them later on, by gaining more knowledge. It can strengthen bonds between the people you ask for help. Advice will never hurt you, it will always help in whatever you need.       ";0
"Student-Designed Summer Project

Every student looks forward to summer, it's the time when you get to have fun and not be stressed out about homework. However, some teachers give summer projects that need to be completed. Students dread doing these because they feel like it's taking time away from what is supposed to be their break from school. Sometimes it's necessary for schools to assure students continue to learn during their summer break. However, summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more responsibility, it's a way for students to express themselves, and there is a higher chance of completion.

Firstly, if students are in charge of their own summer projects it gives them more responsibility. Having a summer project is a responsibility on its own because most students don't want to worry about school while they are on their break, but giving students the chance to create their own can teach them more than if a teacher were to create the project. For example, if students would like to learn more and challenge themselves, they are going to make their projects more difficult, which can help their future education. Letting students take control can also teach them time management because they need time to create their project, complete it and enjoy their summer. It is obvious that letting students create their own project is more beneficial because it gives them more responsibility.

Secondly, giving students a chance to design their own project can help them express themselves. A student is more likely to do an assignment if it involves something they are interested in. If an English teacher were to give a book to read over the summer and write a summary about it, most students would not complete it or put no effort into it. Students don't want to spend their summer writing essays. If students were in control of the project they could use a hobby or talent to complete the assignment. For example, some students find producing videos interesting, so they could create a trailer of the book summarizing it instead of writing an essay. This shows letting students show off their creativity can make a summer project enjoyable.

Finally, letting students come up with their own project, that they can personalize, will make them want to complete it. If a teacher were to do it, they would procrastinate or not finish it. Every student procrastinates, it's just part of being in school. When summer comes around students forget about everything that is school related.

School is the last thing students think about when they're on break, so summer projects should be something students want to do, and will enjoy doing so they don't forget about it. Obviously if students design a summer project that fits their interests they're more likely to complete it.

Many would say that students wouldn't learn from creating their own project because students would make it too easy, and it would make it hard for teachers to grade. However, students learn at different paces and have different abilities. Hence why giving every student the same project is not fair because some might be spending more time of their break working on it than others. As if the students had the ability to design it, they know what they're capable of, and how much they can learn from the assignment. When it comes to grades, teachers should have a rubric and as long as students have what's necessary for the project then it won't be difficult to grade. Also, letting students come up with their summer projects would give teachers less work to do. Students should have the chance to design their own summer project because it can make both the teachers's and students' lives easier.

In conclusion, students can express themselves, complete the assignment on time, have more responsibilities and prepare for the future, if they are able to design their own summer project. A couple months before school ends all they can think about is summer, how close they are to being done with school. Except they are not because they have a summer project to work on, but if they are able to design it then it will be more beneficial. Creating a summer project will benefit the student more than doing one designed by the teacher. Schools should consider this preposition because it makes it easier for the teacher and enjoyable for the student.            ";0
"Have you ever been through a tough time? A death in the family, a bad athletic performance in your last sporting event, maybe you and your spouse just ended a lengthy relationship. Hard times, and the feelings that come with them should not be spread out for your peers to see. I disagree with the Facial Action Coding System. Kids and young adults should be able to hide their emotions becuase not everyone deserves to know how they feel.

Everyone has different feelings. Some negative, some posotive. If you are in class and your mom calls informing you that a loved one has been seriously injured and they are in critical condition, the feelings you have at that moment belong to you and only you. If you are in class and the coding system says that you are feeling 90 percent sad and 10 percent fearful, your classmates are ging to attack you with questions that could possibly worsen your mental state.

I understand that the system could increase test scores and grade averages, but the one thing that means the most is your security. Teachers' lives would be much easier due to the fact that they know which students need help and which students are soaking up the lesson well. There is just one problem. People (especially the youth) are insocure. Privacy is very important in this world and I believe the Facial Action Coding System would snatch that away from us.

All in all, there are pros and cons when discussing the coding system. More cons than pros in my opinion. The idea of feelings being released for everyone to see is too risky. If we unleash the beast into schools around the world, things could flip upside down.";0
"Have you ever seen something unusual in the ground? If so do you think it was created by humans or just a natural landform of some sort. Many people believe that most landforms on earth are made by humans, The face on mars is a natural landform.

If the ""face' on mars was created by alliens it would look a lot different. Many people think alliens look weird, Well the ""face"" on mars wastn't so weird looking. It looked almost like a human face. You would think that alliens would make something radical and not just a face in their planet. Many people seem to believe that they would make something simple.

Eventhough many people were not satisfied with the theory that NASA gave them, NASA went on to search for more clues as to which ""alliens made the landform."" From the pictures that they took you would think that they would be able to detect whether alliens even walked/ touched the surface of the landform.

If you think that alliens made the landform, I would suggest you look at the picture more closely. Just because its on a planet like mars doesnt mean it was made by an allien. I mean how many people actually believe in alliens anyway? If you've never seen them how do you know if they even exist? Take another quick look at the picture tell what you think. Is it even possible for alliens to be alive even if it is on another planet?

The ""face"" on mars is a natural landform. What leads me to beieve that, is that i dont think alliens are real. Maybe they are real, but why would they make something so simple as a face. Dont you think they wouldve went a little overboard with their creations?";0
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"",the author tells us about the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify humans emotions. This article provides how they can show that this device knows how to make an idenitfication.

First, the author states how this device can read are emotions. This device is idetified as Facial Action Coding System. In paragraph 1 the author states ""at least acording to some new computer software that can recongize emotions"". The author also states in paragraph 1 how ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computer to comunticate"". This device can reconginze are emotions in a new way that could help are teachers.

Second,the author states that are emotions are getiing identified by a device. In paragraph 6, the author states that,""if you smile when a Web ad appeears on your screen, a similar ad might follow"". Another example in the same paragraph But if you frown,the next ad will bedifferent ""A classroom coputer could recongize when a student is bceoming confues or bored"". Also in paragraph 3,""For example , your frontails pars lateralis mucsle (about your eyes) rasies your eyeborw when your suprised:your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tighten your lips to show angery"". This shows how the device can idetify are emotions.

Finally,the author states how this device works in the situatuion that it does. In paragraph 3,""The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles"". Another example,""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This shows that the device can idefity from picture and human facial recongition.

All of this information that this aticle gives might be a good thing for student to use in a classroom. This device could tell teachers if there making there student intrestend in class. It might helpp to learn more about what will make the kids more intrested in class . Instead of sitting there sleeping or not doing anything. This device could make people more happy in classeroom.

"Dear Senator,

I think we should change our voting method from the Electoral College to popular vote. The Electoral College consists of only 538 people. That's pretty much saying 538 people in America get to choose who our next president is. I think it should be set up by popular vote because their are millions of people in the U.S. that are able to vote, and each individual person's vote should count. The Electoral College is wrong because if there are about 100,000 people voting in a state, and 60,000 people vote for the Democratic side, and 40,000 votes for the Republican side, the Electoral College votes will go to the Democratic president and those other 40,000 Republicans would have voted for nothing. The Electoral College is one of the main reasons half of America doesn't vote. If one state wins the Republican electoral votes every single year, the Democrats will just stop voting. Then most of the Republicans will stop voting because they know they will win, and this will happen in every state until about 25% of America is voting, or possibly less. The popular vote gives evrybody a chance to win.

I do think the Electoral College is better in some ways though. First of all, the Electoral College is full of people that know why they're voting. They know about their candidates and what their candidates are going to do for the U.S. Most of the population that votes in the popular vote don't know why they're voting. They vote simply on if somebody is black or white, Democratic or Republican. I bet if most of America's voters did some research on their candidates, the polls would be very different. I think another good thing about the Electoral College is that the bigger the population of a city, the more Electoral votes it has. If you win the Electoral Vote, you are most likely going to win the popular vote. And another plus side is that a candidate can not rely on a single region to win. He has to be in the favor of multiple regions in order to win the Election. These are some reasons against the thought of popular vote.

"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 👋

So, I know you're always trying to find ways to make school more interesting and fun for us, and I think you're on the right track with this whole ""giving us the choice"" thing. Like, let's be real, school can be super boring sometimes, and if we didn't have to take the same classes every year, it would be way more enjoyable. 😴

I think giving us the choice to take a music, drama, or art class is a great idea. I mean, who doesn't love making music, acting, or creating art? It's like, a way for us to express ourselves and be creative, you know? And it's not like we're not learning anything in those classes, because we totally are! 🤓

Like, I know some people might be more into math and science, and that's cool, but for me, I'm more of a creative person. So, having the option to take a music class would be amazing. I could finally learn how to play the guitar or piano, and maybe even write my own songs! 🎶 And who knows, maybe I'll even start a band with my friends! 🤘

And don't even get me started on drama. I mean, I know some people might think it's cheesy or whatever, but let's be real, acting is a great way to improve your communication skills and learn how to work with others. Plus, it's just plain fun! 🎭 I could totally see myself being a total drama queen (in a good way, of course) and performing on stage in front of a live audience. 💁‍♀️

And art, omg, art is like, the best. I mean, it's like, a way for us to express ourselves through visual means, you know? Like, I could finally learn how to draw and paint and stuff, and maybe even sell my art at a gallery or something! 🎨 I know some people might be more into digital art, and that's cool too. The point is, having the choice to take an art class would be amazing and super fun.";1
"Driverless Cars are Coming is a story about cars that don't really require a human driver. It talks about the history of driverless cars and how far they have come. It also gives some examples of some driverless cars. However, in the story it describes how these driverless cars have some positive and negative aspects. I believe that these cars have positive aspects and should be developed more because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel, the drivers will be more alert, and they have a lot of safety functions.

To begin with, I am for the development for the driverless cars because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel. For example, in the story it says, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial notion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.""

In addition, the next reason I am for the development of driverless car is because the drivers will be more alert. For example, in the story it says, ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" The story also says, "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" Finally, one last example from the story is when it says, ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.""

Finally, the last reason I am for the development of driverless cars is because they have a lot of safety functions. For example, in the story it says, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over---something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" Also, another example the story says is, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.""

In conclusion, I am for the development of driverless cars because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel, the drivers will be more alert, and they have a lot of safety functions.                        ";0

"Phones and Driving

Drivers should not be able to have the use of a cellphone while conducting a vehicle. People die every day in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Each year over 330,000 accidents happen due to being distracted over a phone. Studies show that a cell phone puts drivers at a four time greater risk. Although many people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences and studies showing that the use of a cell phone while conducting a vehicle is dangerous and people should avoid using them while driving.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road, which makes it easy to forget that everyone else shares the roads as well. Many cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. This is what leads to fatal accidents. People may think they can multitask while conducting a vehicle and using their cellular devices but in reality that is not the case. Studies show that no matter how concentrated you may think you are, you cause an accident. Whether it's you hitting something small, making others get into an accident, or yourself hitting another car.

Hands-free phones are just as disturbing as holding a phone. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from the road. Although hands-free devices do not increase safety, but causes the same amount of distraction as if one were holding a phone. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from paying attention to the road. Studies show that the reaction time significantly reduces when paying attention to a phone rather than the road for an aged person. Now imagine how much more this affects an elderly person.

Many drivers keep their cell phones in their vehicles. However, when it rings, they are not going to ignore it because of how tempted they will be to reach for it. Therefore, they lose all concentration while driving, and all the focus is on the phone. Many States have rightfully stopped local governments from prohibiting cell phone use while conducting a vehicle due to many fatal accidents. Many people continue to do it and not follow the law. In addition, for those people are who to blame for when someone innocent loses their life because of someone else being distracted over their phone.

Not only should cellular devices be prohibited completely but, the law as well should be changed to not having a device at all while conducting a vehicle. This will prevent many accidents as well as saving many lives. Many people already do not follow the law and maybe never will. Only way they will actually respect the law is if an accidents happens to them or they get caught not obeying the law. Therefore, people should be restricted from using cellular devices while conducting a vehicle. No one wants to go through a terrible accident nor be the reason for a fatality.                           ";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that all students should be required to have a certain amount of community service. This could consist of helping out teachers after school, picking up trash at local parks, and even helping out with non-profit community events. However, the key to this institution would be that the students don't get paid.

In these times, I personally think that kids have too much money. Whether it comes from an allowance, or a gift, the students get too much undeserved money. I do understand that some kids work for there money, but they need to learn what service is, and the other kind of payment that you get from it. I myself have participated in many service projects, and over the years I have found that I get a sense of accomplishment that you get with nothing else that you do. This is what I mean by the ""other"" kind of payment. When you get money, even if you have worked for it, you just are happy about the profit that you have gained, and all you think about is what you could possibly spend it on. By doing service, you feel that you have helped someone with something that they could not have done without you. This could help to increase thoughts of self-worth, and self-esteem. Then that could lead to better concentration, and better focus on school work, and the things that are most important in life.

Service could also provide a good distraction from other things. If students have something good to do, and they realize that it makes them feel good about themselves, they will most likely stay away from other things. For instance drugs, parties that may have bad activities, and other dishonorable endeavors. In fact, service can almost be like a drug itself. Although a good drug, it can give you a high of self-confidence. This can then lead to an addiction where the victim would continue wanting to do it so that they could feel that way again. In all, service can act as a good distraction from other harmful things.

Another reason that service is good is because it will teach students skills that they may need later in life. For instance, I have participated in many service projects regarding service including building shelves in a concession stand, painting, building fences, and even bridges. All of these are skills that I may use, and maybe even need later in life. There is no doubt that service can teach students life skills, and lessons.

In all I think that service is a very important part of the growth, and development of not only our local school students, but of this entire nation. Service can lead to success in many fields, and we need to experience it to become successful, honest, and independent adults.

"When people ask for advice why do they sometimes ask many people? In my opinion i think that asking more than one person can help you get more information than just asking one person. What can asking multiple people for their opinion do rather than just asking one person for their opinion. Why do people want to ask other people ask for advice rather than not knowing it. Why do they like to get multiple opinions on what their asking and not just asking one person for their opinion.

What can asking multiple people for their opinion do than asking person. Why do people ask many not just one person for advice, By asking many people it can get you more advice on the subject and help you know more about what your asking about. Getting more opinions can help you because it can get you more advice and by getting more advice helps the person asking know more. What does it help by asking more than one person it can get you get you more advice just in case you did not know.

Why do people want to ask other people ask for advice rather than not asking for advice. People like to ask other because the one that they are asking might know more than if you where to not ask . Not knowing what you want to know can effect you because if you will need to know it. Asking others helps you because it can make what ever your wanting to know easier by getting help and asking.

Why do they like to get multiple opinions on what their asking and not just asking one person for their opinion. People ask for many others opinions so that they can make sure there right and not wrong because if you ask for one persons opinion they might be wrong. The benefits of asking multiple people are you ca learn more than you wanted and know exactly what you needed to know. So in conclusion is better to ask multiple people rather than just one person because it can get you to know more so asking more than one person is a good thing to do so next time you want to know something ask multiple people rather than one.  ";0
"Imagine you are looking for some advice and you need someone to talk to you, that's where your friends and family come in. There are lots of people to give you advice in life or school such as your teachers, family, friends, etc. Seeking multiple opinions from different people can help someone make a better choice because they give you facts and more choices for you to choose from.

When the people you care for give you their opinions of advice to choose from, one of those opinions could be the right one. Sometimes life can be difficult and confusing, that is why you have people around you to guide you through the right way. Let's say one day you want to commit a crime and your family finds out, they will give you the right advice and talk you out of it. Every one of your friends will need advice someday, whether it's at school or at your house, and you will be the one to give them good opinions to help them make a better choice. For example, you have a friend who needs a way to study better and she thinks the best way is to cheat, well, you need to talk some sense into her and tell her to get a study buddy or hire a tutor. Cheating is never the answer, there is always a way to help someone make a better choice before they regret doing something that could get them in trouble. When people ask for advice and you give them multiple opinions to help them make a good choice, those opinions also make them better people. However, there are some people in the world who will convince you to do the wrong thing, and you can't let them fool you into making a bad decision, this is why you ask more than one person because there is someone who will tell you the correct thing to do. A good example would be that your friend encourages, convinces, and influences you into stealing a $5,000 car and if you didn't do it, they would never talk to you again, even though you know what you're doing is wrong and illegal. Finally, your best friend tells you not to do it because you know what the consequences will be if you do steal the car, and your opinion made her realize that she is choosing the best choice which is not stealing the car. Your friends and family will always be there to give you great opinions to make better choices.

Everyone you go to for advice will not only give you their opinion, they will give you the facts, as well. The facts are the most important part to making a better choice because opinions are just what people feel you should do, the facts tell you what is gonna happen if you do the wrong thing and what'll happen if you do the right thing. For example, lets say that you want to say mean things to your teacher because she didn't answer your question, but if you do say mean things to her you know that you'll either get in school restriction, suspension, or you'll get expelled, so since you know these facts, you know that it is wrong to say those things and you will not do it. If anyone ever needed advice, you'd have to give them facts, too, not just opinions because letting people know how you feel may not stop how they feel they should handle stuff. Lets say that I really want to buy a new video game but neither of my parents let me, so I steal cash from a wallet that fell on the floor and use it to by myself the video game. Then, my mom sees me steal money from the wallet and tells me what she thinks I should do, but I don't care what she feels, so I buy the video game with the $20 I stole. Since she didn't give me the facts of what would happen, which is going to jail or to court, I bought a video game with stolen money. When you do something that is bad, you always regret it, and look back to the facts your friends/family told you, and wish you had listened to them. Another example would be you needed to make some money, so you're selling a concert ticket you found in your moms purse, which is illegal and you've been warned not to do it again, and you got caught by the police again. The policeman takes you to jail, then your parents bail you out, and after all that, you wish you had listened to the police the first time, and when your mother warned you to stop doing it. This is why facts are super important when it comes to making a better choice because you look back and wish you had made a best choice.

In conclusion, I say that seeking multiple opinions will help someone make a better choice because if you ask a lot of people they will make sure that you make the right decision and it will also make you a better person. Remember, if someone asks you for advice, you have to give them the facts about what'll happen if you make the wrong decision, and lots of ideas on what to do. There is always someone to help you, and like I said before, lead your friends and family down and through the correct path.";0
"Day after day you do the same thing, nothing new happens and all you do is participate in the classes you have to take.

Well now your your school is allowing you to decide what activities or clubs you want be a part of, they are letting you decide.

I believe students should participate in an extracurricular activity. It will allow students to try something new, expand their opportunities, and meet new people.

You can't live life doing one thing everyday, it's not healthy. If you really like something and you do it everyday that is great, but it just isn't good for your body.

It can affect you mentally and physically.

Everyone must try to exercise all parts of their body and not just one part.

Another reason is that students might be scared or predict they won't like it.

How do they know it will be bad?

I remember my mom made me take a Lego building class in third grade and I thought I was going to hate it, and I did at first.

The reason I did is because I went into that class with the wrong mindset.

I needed to go in with a happier attitude.

So the next time I did and it was actually really fun.

Taking that class help grow my love for engineering.

Now I take a robotics class and plan on pursuing my love of engineering all the way through high school.

Never judge a book by it's cover.

Give something new a try and maybe it will turn out great.

An extracurricular activity will help increase opportunities.

It is not good to just have one skill or practice.

It is cool that someone is really proficient in one area, but jobs want people to be proficient in a lot of areas.

They like people with a variety of skills.

Having that after school activity or even activities will help create new skills.

It is the school giving you a new set of skills.

Also, some people might think that they are going to pursue one topic, but realize they like something else.

My father told me that he wished his middle school had as many extracurricular activities as mine.

It took him all the way up to his junior year of high school to realize he like construction and civil engineering.

Our schools give us so may opportunities and ways to broaden our horizon, so why not take advantage of it.

Extracurricular activities are great ways to meet new people.

In my first year of middle school I participated in a running club.

I liked to run, but I had no idea who was in the club.

To me everyone was complete strangers.

We would do buddy running which is basically where you both run at the exact same pace and push each other to go faster.

My buddy was Generic_Name I didn't even know his name for the first week.

One day I decided to talk to him and we instantly became friends.

After that running became so much easier and we both improved are mile times by a lot.

If I didn't try to talk to Generic_Name that day I would be short one best friend right now.

I am positive that if any student participated in a club they would have to talk to someone new at least once.

And they might find that someone to be the funniest kid ever or the nicest.

They will never know until they join an after school activity.

Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

It will help to find new career paths and hobbies, increase a persons opportunities, and make new relationships.

If a school is giving you a chance to have all of the thing I have listed, why wouldn't you participate in an after after school club.";0
"I do not approve to let people use any type of technology to read emotions. That is when it gets weird and people ask why are you feeling this way. This can sometimes lead to the student getting even sadder or madder than they were. If they are left alone and no one knows what is wrong, they will be fine.

To start off, expressions can not forsure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The FACS can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy. This means it can make you SLIGHTLY happy but not enough to classify yourself as happy and I do not approve to let people read emotions. It is unnecessary and we should be researching something better than this.               ";0
"MONTH_DAY_YEAR

Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. This is all I wanted to tell you , I hope you listen to what I'm trying to tell you. I know I am not the only one that thinks like this. If you would like to contact me back you could email me at EMAIL_ADDRESS. Thankyou and have a great day!

"As an eighth-grade student, I am aware that graduation is a significant milestone in my academic career. In order to graduate, I must complete the required classes and pass the associated tests. In this essay, I will research the required classes for graduation in my school district and the tests related to those classes.

First, I will begin by researching the required classes for graduation. In my school district, the required classes for graduation are English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and a foreign language. These classes are designed to provide students with a well-rounded education and prepare them for success in college and beyond.

In addition to these required classes, students may also choose to take elective classes. Elective classes allow students to explore their interests and pursue areas of study that may not be required for graduation. Examples of elective classes in my school district include art, music, and physical education.

Aside from the required classes, students must also pass the SOL (Standards of Learning) tests in order to graduate. The SOL tests are designed to assess student knowledge and mastery of the required classes. These tests are mandatory for all students in Virginia and are used to determine if students are ready to graduate.

The SOL tests are divided into two categories: content area tests and end-of-course tests. Content area tests are designed to assess student knowledge in specific subject areas, such as English, Mathematics, and Science. End-of-course tests, on the other hand, are designed to assess student knowledge and mastery of a specific course, such as Algebra I or World History.

In order to pass the SOL tests, students must achieve a certain score. The passing score for each SOL test varies depending on the subject area and grade level. For example, the passing score for the English SOL test for eighth grade is 800 out of 800.

In conclusion, graduation in my school district requires students to complete the required classes and pass the associated SOL tests. The required classes are designed to provide students with a well-rounded education and prepare them for success in college and beyond. The SOL tests are mandatory for all students in Virginia and are used to determine if students are ready to graduate. By understanding the requirements for graduation, students can better prepare themselves for success in their academic career";1
"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to learn valuable life skills that will benefit us in the future. One of these skills is cleaning. While it may not seem like an exciting task, cleaning our homes is essential for maintaining a healthy and comfortable living environment. In order to improve my house cleaning skills, I propose that I clean the house every Saturday for two months.

Firstly, cleaning the house every Saturday will allow me to practice and improve my cleaning skills on a regular basis. By performing the same tasks every week, I will become more familiar with the cleaning products and techniques that are most effective. This will ultimately lead to a cleaner and more organized home.

Secondly, cleaning the house every Saturday will teach me the importance of responsibility and accountability. By taking on this task, I will be responsible for keeping the house clean and tidy. This will help me develop a sense of ownership and pride in my home, as well as a sense of responsibility towards my family and roommates.

Furthermore, cleaning the house every Saturday will also teach me the importance of time management and organization. In order to effectively clean the house, I will need to plan my time and prioritize my tasks. This will help me develop important skills that will serve me well in the future, both in and out of the classroom.

In conclusion, cleaning the house every Saturday for two months will allow me to practice and improve my house cleaning skills, teach me the importance of responsibility and accountability, and help me develop important skills such as time management and organization. While it may not be the most exciting task, I believe that it is an important one that will benefit me in the long run.";1
"Limiting car usage has lots of important advantages. By limiting car usage, we can, lower harmful greenhouse gas levels, reduce smog, and improve our environment and society. It wont happen immediately, but i do believe that if we start to limit car usage, that it will greatly benefit the world.

To begin with, cars cause a lot of the problems we are having with harmful greenhouse gas. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Paragraph 5, Source 1) Greenhouse gas emmisions are extremely harmful to the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases harm the earth's atmoshphere and we as humans, need the atmosphere to protect us from harmful radiation. By limiting car use, you are technically saving the planet and everyone on it.

Second of all, cars cause smog. Smog is extremely harmful to breathe in and is also bad for the environment. For example, in Paris, France, the government enforced a driving ban to alleviate the thick smog. After a few days of less cars on the road, the smog cleared up! (Source 2) This proves that if we didn't have cars in the cities that have smog such as Beijing and Paris, then smog would be much less of a problem and cities would be a much more healthy and safe place to live. Therefore, limiting cars results in less smog.

The last reason that limiting car usage is beneficial is that it will improve the environment and society. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth, sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic; and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Source 3) This shows that by reducing car usage, it has helped the city's economy and created a better place to live for its citizens. Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company, envisioned a world where personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He saw a world that would ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" (Source 4) This shows that by reducing car usage, the environment and society can be improved drastically.

All in all, I strongly believe that by reducing car usage, we can make the world a better place. By doing so, we can limit harmful green house gas, reduce smog, and change society for the better. These are only a few of the advantages of limiting car usage but you can already see why it is such a good idea. I hope you can take this information and make the world a better place.    ";0
"Summer break provides students with a time to relax and refresh in preparation for the following year. The break is a necessity in the school systems as it offers students the opportunity to experience different aspects of life outside of the classroom. Additionally, this period to refresh assists students in their learning career as it prevents academic burnout. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. In situations where summer projects are assigned, projects should be student-designed for they allow students to take initiative in their learning, gain a deeper understanding of the chosen topic, and minimize the chance that students feel they are not being given a break.

In allowing students to design their own project, the student is given the opportunity to take charge of their learning. The initiative a student-designed project offers allows students to choose a topic they are interested in and later hope to pursue. For example, a young student with little interest in art and literature would not benefit from being forced to read certain novels throughout the summer. Exposure to the essential texts needed to further their language abilities will be gained throughout the school year. Therefore, as the school year already provides students with the basic skills to advance their academic career, summer should be a time students have the opportunity to pursue their own interests, best achieved through the completion of student-designed projects.

Likewise, with the idea that a student designs a project on a topic they are interested in, the project will be done more thoroughly, allowing students to gain a deeper understanding. As a human tendency, people are more likely to work on something they are interested and excited about. The more the project is worked on, the more complex and thorough it will be. Interest and excitement in a topic positively affect the extent to which the project will be worked on. Typically, the time spent on the project is directly related to the overall understanding of the concept. Considering teachers assign summer work to assure students continue learning during their break, projects should be student-designed as they promote a deeper understanding of the given topic.

Lastly, having students complete a project they have designed themselves minimizes the feeling of the traditional school dynamic. Throughout the school year, students are assigned the work they need to complete in order to receive an ""A."" Completing work is often done out of requirement rather than personal interest. Summer is used as a break from the many requirements of school. A student-designed project will seem like less of a requirement as it is based upon self-interest. Minimizing the feeling that the work must be done out of requirement ensures students have the time to refresh while continuing their academics.

In conclusion, summer is a vital time for students to take a break from the hardships of the previous school year. Yet, some teachers want to assure students continue their learning over the break. If a school believes summer work should be assigned, projects should be student-designed. A project designed by a student encourages them to take initiative in their learning, gain a deeper understanding of the chosen topic, and still feel as if they had a break from school and its traditional dynamic. ";0
"The Presidental Elections .

The elections are a brutal time canididates compete for the favor of the citizens they campain, give great speaches about why they would be best for the position of leading the nation, often state why their adversary would be the worst person for the job. This causes oposition in the nation tearing it apart, however now not only are the people emotional about the election but also about the process, their are aguments about whether or not that the orginal process sould remain. The system that the  elections have been held sence the Constitution has been written was that each citizen in a state would vote for one canadidate or the other by voting for the electors of that specific person then  the electors in turn would vote for the cannidate and their votes would decide the presidency as stated in paragraph six and seven of the first source""

What Is the Electoral College?""  by the Office of the Federal Register . This system althoug it has worked so far it is not the best way of conducting the elections in this time and age citizens should modify and conform the process to fit the need we have now.

The problems claimed by the ones opoised to the electoral college, as told in the second source "" The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, are that the process cause individuals to have little to no say in the person that will be their leader for years, they do not have control over who their canadidates elect and must simply hope that they do indead vote for who they promised to, also the election is decieded by the few states that do not have a predetermined majority of voters in each state leaving the rest of the country feeling left out of the feasco of the election and as if their perfered canidate dose not care of them or their support and opinions. This persents the system to be truly flawed in the way that it is curantly operateing.

Individuals,as source three ""In Defense of the Electorial College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, wish to claim that the system is not flawed in great lenghts because it has worked for such a time that it is seen by them sufficant in its orcastration. It is said that the electors often do vote for who they pleaged they would and that decite is uncomon: however why should America risk the posibility of decite it has happened befor and if not prevented it will happen again. Do we not owe it to ourselves, posterity, and country to fix all potental harms to our nation the presidency should not be taken lightly it is a grand position that gives power and fame to all who hold those who have it could maintain the country, grace the nation with new prosperity, or condem Americans to years of suffering, toil, and misery. As citizens we should not alow anyone but the most valid character obtain this place. Mistakes are not alowed! we should take it upon ourselves now to modify this method be for it is to late and avertid.

There is no mitake America must act fast and modify this method for the nation, for their children, and for themselves.    ";0
"Have you ever felt confused? Have you ever felt like you were in the dark about something and couldn't figure out what to do? Whether it be through a tutor, a friend, or a family member, you may have asked more than one person for help or advice to solve a problem. They may give you bad advice, great advice, or maybe change your mind about something. This is why asking multiple people for advice can help you make a better choice because it can broaden your mindset, people may have more experience, and you can view more than one side.

First, advice from multiple people can help broaden your mindset. You may find yourself seeing the situation in a more serious or less serious way, and may find an easier way of how to deal with it. The fact that you have heard more than one opinion means that you can prepare if the situation somehow changes, which brings us to our next reason. Next, you can switch plans if the decision ever arises. Only one person could probably not give you all the advice you need, so more than one persons ideas could help you come up with a back-up plan to get out of a predicament that you may have not seen coming. Finally, you may change opinions about how to deal with a similar situation in the future, whether it be preparing for a big speech, or simply taking a small quiz. If after everything is taken care of, and you tell yourself ""I could have done it better"" or ""I didnt like the way I dealt with that"", you could form your own opinion or make your own advice to give out of your own experience and everyone elses.

Second, asking more experienced people may help you find a much easier way to deal with future problems. First they may offer more helpful advice. They may have been in the same spot you were in many times, and may have found a more easier way to deal with it each time, similar to how you may get the most recent and updated information from a website while doing research. Next, more experienced people may have different, more efficient ways to deal with a problem. There may be different ways to deal with the same type of situation, and you didn't realize. So when you run into the same problem again and you use the same technique to deal with it but it doesn't seem to work, just switch to Plan B that someone suggested to you. Another reason is that they may simply give you more straight-forward advice. Some people can give you a more complicated suggestion that you may not understand until after everything is dealt with, and that may be frustrating. The same person your'e asking for advice may have had that happen to them, and they try to avoid giving you that constant state of frustration, so they can just skip right to the important points.

The third and final reason is that you view more than one side. If you only ask certain people for help, they can give you advice for when you deal with the problem, you may not see the whole picture and end up dealing with consequences you didnt expect. If you ask multiple people, you can see the situation clearly and carefully deal with everything so unexpected consequences don't come out of nowhere and mess it all up. You can also make wiser decisions since you've heard every side. Finally, you can learn to avoid more habits that could have made the situation harder to deal with before.

In conclusion, it is always better to ask more than one person for help because it can make you more aware of what to do in the future, people who have more experience can help you make easier decisions, and you can view more than one side of the situation. Asking one person alone for advice may give you less ways to deal with something, while asking multiple people for their opinions means that you can combine all of their ideas to prepare for anything left to come.";0
"Electoral College,are you against it or not? I would perfer that we keep this ""despised method"" for choosing our president.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This is a desierable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful prsident. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes don't count,that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A large state gets more attention form presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is no pressure for the run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.                 ";0
"Dear State Senator,

While I normally don't have any complaints, and being the person I am not many things ""bug me"", but I recently found that I disagree with a certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.

The electoral college is unfair in many ways, this one however can be seen as minor. The electoral college gives an easier way to get  tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.

Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president.

In the article I read, it stated ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational"" I agree completely. How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument.

Thank you for your time and please take this into consideration, I realize that it has its upsides but it is just unfair, outdated, and irrational. And please notice the other downsides aswell, while I did not have the time or room to include them.

"Teachers are paid to give students their insight, and teach them to the best of their ability. So why not let them do their job? Teachers should design the projects that their students complete over the summer. This is because they are more experienced, educated, and objective than their students. Teachers are more experienced because they have spent a lot more time on the subject than their students have. Also, many teachers have received a formal education in teaching which gives them a better insight on what to assign over the summer. Finally, many students would prefer to have no summer project. Therefore, many students would be bias in the creation of their own summer assignment. Letting students design their own summer projects would not be implausible. However, students would overall benefit from completing teacher-designed projects as appose to their own student-designed projects.

Teachers are more experienced in teaching than their students are. Many teachers have devoted many years to teaching students. These teachers have learned what assignments are most effective and how to stimulate their students in such a way that makes them interested in what they are learning. My English teacher has been teaching English for 30 years. She is one of the best teachers I have met because she has accumulated lots of experience throughout her 30 years of teaching. Student would never hope to create an assignment as well as an experienced teacher. This highlights the gap between teacher and student. Many students would benefit a lot more from letting teachers create their summer projects. Additionally, teachers have more than just experience.

Teachers have received a proper education in teaching their students. Many teachers go to college to receive a formal education in the art of education. This gives them more knowledge than the students in how to help them learn. My chemistry teacher has a bachelors in teaching and a masters in organic chemistry, it felt like she had an endless well of knowledge on chemistry. It would be a lot more efficient to have teachers ,who have spent years learning how to teach do their job, than to relegate that responsibility to students who have no education in teaching. Even if these teachers don't have the best education they should still design their own summer projects.

Students are very subjective when it comes to the topic of their own assignments. Most students would prefer to receive no summer assignments. If they had the opportunity to assign their own summer projects they would try to give themselves as little work as possible. In 6th grade my teacher gave my class an assignment called the ""genius hour project"" in which the students had the entire year to research any topic they were interested in. Many students took advantage of the nature of the project and tried to give themselves as little work as possible. Some students even ""learned"" topics they were already well versed in to try to put in as little effort as possible. Even if this is a small sample size it shows the nature of students and how they are willing to take the path of least resistance even if they dont really learn anything.

In conclusion, teachers should design their own summer projects because of a multitude of reasons. Teachers are more qualified to design the students their own summer projects because teachers have more experience, education, and insight on teaching. On top of all of that they are also more objective when designing summer assignments, especially when compared to their students. I do believe that students do have the ability to create their own summer projects, but it would be more effective to let the teachers do what they are best at. These are the reasons teacher should design their own summer projects.            ";0
"One hundred years ago inovators wouldn't have dreamed of inventing driverless cars. The very thought of an automobile being able to drive itself would have been a feet only the gods could do.

Many would say that driverless cars are unsafe and would needlessly use up time and energy but the truth of the matter is, driverless cars are our doorway to another world of inventions that could not only benefit our daily lives but save others as well.

Inovators around the globe agree that self-driving cars are, at least, a great accomplishment for humanity. Until 2009 cars, such as these, did not even exist; because of the brillant minds of many amazing inovators, we can now say that humans are one step closer to a new type of world that doesn't have to involve death because of irresponsible and reckless drivers. In the passage ""Driverless Car are Coming"" the author even states that ""The in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" Of course the author is right, but what about all the sensors cars like these would come equipped with? Many say that these cars would lead to disaster and countless car accidents but, in fact, these cars are safer than any other we have seen before.

Although we are not quite ready for driverless cars to be driven around town, inventions, such as these, are what make our civilization so unique. Self-driving cars are not only impressive because of how complicated they are, but the idea that someone could have to think that these cars could be made possible. Driverles cars are safe and might include back-up options in case something goes wrong and the driver needs to steer. Law-makers feel these automobiles cannot be safely driven around other individuals but they have obviously not looked into how able these cars actually are. These cars are what gives us a chance at other inventions that we cannot even fathom down the road. These automobiles are what will insure that our futures may be just a bit brighter because of these self-abled cars. ";0
"Curfew laws have been a topic of debate for many years. Some people believe that a nationwide curfew law would be beneficial, while others argue that it would be detrimental. In this essay, I will research the current laws concerning curfews among different regions in the United States and analyze different views of adults and young people concerning having a nationwide curfew law in the United States. I will also identify pros and cons to having this law and evaluate whether a nationwide curfew law should be imposed.

Curfew laws vary from state to state in the United States. Some states have strict curfew laws, while others have more lenient laws. For example, in California, the curfew law is only enforced for minors who are under the age of 18. In contrast, in New York, the curfew law is enforced for minors who are under the age of 16. These laws are designed to keep young people safe and prevent them from engaging in illegal activities.

However, not everyone is in favor of curfew laws. Some people argue that curfew laws restrict young people's freedom and limit their ability to socialize. They also argue that curfew laws are not effective in preventing crime. Instead, they create a false sense of security and divert resources away from more effective crime-fighting strategies.

Despite these arguments, there are several pros to having a nationwide curfew law. Firstly, it would provide a consistent set of rules for young people across the United States. This would make it easier for young people to understand what is expected of them and would reduce the confusion caused by varying curfew laws in different states. Secondly, a nationwide curfew law would provide a consistent set of rules for law enforcement officers to enforce. This would make it easier for them to identify and enforce curfew laws consistently across the United States.

However, there are also several cons to having a nationwide curfew law. Firstly, it would restrict young people's freedom and limit their ability to socialize. This could lead to feelings of isolation and depression among young people. Secondly, a nationwide curfew law would be difficult to enforce consistently across the United States. Law enforcement officers would have to be trained to enforce the law consistently, which could be a challenge";1

"In some schools, students are required to complete summer projects to continue learning over their break. These summer projects insure that students enter the school year prepared for learning, and have an easier adjustment to the start of school. When these summer projects are student-designed, it gives the students opportunities to explore a wide range of topics that wouldn't normally fall in school curriculum, and learn about something they are passionate about and enjoy doing it. This is why summer projects should be designed by students, not by teachers.

When students are given the opportunity to explore topics of their own choice, they have a chance to learn something that doesn't fall within the typical curriculum of schools. In schools, the main subjects taught are Math, History, Science and English. When students aren't limited to these basic subjects, it allows them to research something that may not be covered in school. If a student is interested in cooking, but there are no cooking classes at their school, they could choose to learn about it over the summer. The student-designed projects also give students a chance to take control of their learning and direct their projects themselves. Students are able to choose the direction that they want to take their project in. They could present their learning in an essay, virtual presentation, or even in a work of art. This freedom allows the student to customize their project, therefore being more interested in it. When given the responsibility of choosing their own summer project topics, students are able to choose something with significance to them and show their work in individual ways, keeping them interested in their projects.

When summer projects are student-designed, it gives students the opportunity to center their projects around something that fascinates them, which keeps them interested and makes them put in more effort. When schools give out summer work, one big issue that they face is that it is most likely about a topic that students aren't interested in. This leads students to feel bored with their work, and put in less effort. When students are giving the freedom to lead their own projects, they can choose something they like. When they do this they put in more effort, and work harder on it because they are passionate about it. When projects are student led, and they choose their own directions of work, this gives them a chance to learn something from their project, not just work to fulfill guidelines. I once had a summer project to read a book, and it was a book that I was not interested in at all. This led me to just read and write a paper about it for a grade, not to learn. If I had been able to choose something that I was passionate about, I would have been able to learn something from it, and not just work to fulfill guidelines for a paper. A current problem that schools face is that children only work for grades, not to learn and retain information. when students can lead their own projects, they will put in more work because they are passionate about what they are doing and therefore learn information instead of working just for a grade.

When students are restricted to teacher-designed projects, they feel trapped in the guidelines for the project and end up not enjoying the projects. This makes them more likely to put off the assignment to the last minute, which leads to them performing poorly on it. When students are limited to guidelines on a project and don't have the opportunity to customize their project, they end up enjoying it less. When it comes to a summer long project, if a student doesn't enjoy what they are doing it can end up spoiling their summer. When students don't feel passionate about a project and don't have the opportunity to have input on it, they are more likely to put it off to the last minute. if they do this, odds are they will end up doing poorly on it. When I was given the task of reading a book over the summer, it was on a subject that I had no connection to and didn't want to read about. I ended up putting it off till the last week, because I was dreading it so much. This meant that I spent the last week of my summer reading about something that I disliked. When students have the freedom to design their own projects, they can choose something that they enjoy, which makes them less likely to put it off to the minute and do poorly on it.

As our schools face an ongoing struggle of keeping kids interested in their work, student-designed summer projects could be a start to foxing this problem. When students choose the direction of their projects, they aren't restricted to certain topics. This allows them to choose something they are passionate about. This makes them more likely to enjoy their project and actually learn from it.          ";0
"Ok, So some people believe that the ""Unmasking The Face On Mars"" was created by aliens. Crazy right!

Well the Face On Mars is just a natural landform. to back my opinon about this it states in the passage that, "" A spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landings sities for its sister ship Viking 2, when spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" so technicaly thats how the face ofn the mars got there but, thats not it. ""Scientist figured it was another Marthian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Then the huge rock formation it resembled a human head which was formed be the shadows that were giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This would be a good way to engage the public and attraction to Mars the authors had thought. Then it began to starr in a Hollywood film, appreaed in books, magazines, radio talk shows and ect. But NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. but in the mean time defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient cilvilization on mars. but to be dirct the face on Mars was located at 41 degree north martian latitude where it was winter in April. well there is much more to this but this is some of the reasons and facts about how the face on mars was a natural landform.";0
"Grade Change

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should change the policy from having to have an B average to play sports. Most of the kids that play sports have an C average. Well most of the students in the school have an C average. You should change it to C average because maybe they had all A' s and one C that was an eighty four. They was one point away from having an B now they can't play spots because of that one point. I also think you should change it to an C because C is the average persons grade. Most people have an hard time learning things and keeping up with sports so they might make an C on their report card, but an C isn't an bad grade it might not be an A or B but its not bad. I think if you change it we want have anyone participating in sports. Then other schools are going to look at our school like we are boring and be like ""I don't want to go there because they are lame."" We don't want that we want people to look at our school and say ""They have an good athletic field I want to try that school out."" We don't want them looking at the school as an loser school or boring , do we ? What if an parent(s) want to see their kids play but they made an C so they got kicked off the team. The parent(s) are going to be mad that they paid all that money and their child has got kicked off the team. We want to work with the parent(s) not make them mad or angry. That's what's going to happen if you change the average to B. We're going to have a lot of angry parent(s) coming to the school. We don't want an angry mob surrounding the school because their child had got kicked off their favorite sport team. So you should keep it at an C average to make parents, students, outsiders looking in and teachers happy. We don't want the students in class talking about ""We would of won if i had of played."" Then they wouldn't be thinking about school. So you think about that and thank you for taking time out your day to read this letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME";0
"Dear Principal,

All students go to school to give them the skills they need for there future. Knowing that i think that students should be required to do community service to help there future because community service provides a good look in the society and because it helps them learn how to do more great things.

To start off, I think that students should be required to do community service to make good in our society. Couple of months ago my friend volunteered to help clean up the beaches after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. My family and i thought of going down there to help them out.

When we got there, we saw a bunch of people volunteering. I never thought so many people would do all this work for free. I ask my friend and he said because we wanted to make the world better. Maybe if we volunteer in our society we might make the world better for us and others. 6/10 volunteers, volunteer to help the society stated by the Federal Volunteering Committee.

Volunteering should be required in our school because it helps society and it make it easier for others.";0
"Summer break is a time of relief. A stress free vacation for kids who love to relax and not worry about exams, and final papers. A majority of schools allow kids to enjoy summer break, even though, some schools ensure that kids do a summer project to allow them to keep their mind busy throughout the long summer months. Although teachers would not know what the students plans would be, or when they commence, most people say that teachers should design the students summer projects. After all, they know what the student needs to work on, and how to help them if they fail to understand and or, have trouble understanding, and how it will affect them later on in life when they decide to go to collage or the work force.

Teachers know everything about a child academically, they know their strong points while at the same time, helping them strengthen their weak points and their overall success, only thing is, is that the child might have planned something in advance (such as long out of town vacations) and will not have all the time to get it does efficiently and in a timely manner. If kids were to make their own summer project, then they would make it to their appeal, they would make it, to be easy and not challenging their mind. Teachers, on the other hand, would make it fun, critical thinking all in one! Different teachers would also put the specific course too, such as Biology, History ,Algebra I and Algebra II, Geometry, and much more. Who knows, maybe even a language if the student was going abroad. Teachers can come up with special ways make it fun too, especially for science and history. Students can go to a history site and write a paper on how their time was, and what happened on that site. For biology, they can have them go to the zoo and write about what animals they have seen and what type of lands they live in (Grasslands, Deserts, Rain forest ex.)They would also be able to add a checklist to guarantee that the kids understood the topic given. On the plus side, it boosts their grade up for the next school year too, start them up with a outstanding grade.

If a particular student is not doing well in said class or if students were to have a hard time, then the teacher can implement a less challenging project for the kid to their reasonable liking. Instead of them finding it too hard and not accomplishing it, they instead have a sensible feel to it. The student might forget how to do a specific thing or proper procedure or, all together; be to afraid or nervous to ask the teacher for assistance, they are free to ask their parents or other family members to help with the subject. They can even hire a tutor or go to institutes to help them understand the material and help them push forward and reach the extra mile. If the student has been born with a mental illness, such as ADD or ADHD, then the teacher can sit down with them before school ends for the year, and give them extra time and a run down with everything in it to ensure there are less bumps in the road while they are on break.

One far more advanced way it helps is in the long run. Teachers know that high school kids are getting ready to graduate and join the work force or go to collage. They do not want their students to be going into the work force or collage, after having long summers with no work and lollygagging around and being used to not having a care in the world about any sort of paperwork, and go to a more professional job that required a lot of work and paperwork that must be completed within the deadline. Though most kids will not understand until later in life, teachers are trying to give them a feel for what life will become when out of high school. Students will be aware of that upcoming afterwardssand prepare themselves for what lies ahead of their path that they choose. Bosses and Collages like people who know hard work, they like someone who can get the job done efficiently.

There is no reason why, a child cannot complete a summer project. Unless it is for a vacation that takes up all of summer, then they should have partially completed the project It would not take long, students would most likely finish in a week or so. It would be very beneficial to the student that it will get them a better grade at the beginning of the school year, help them improve over all and keep the brain active to the subject, and will help them in the long run with all that life throws at them. One day the students will understand how beneficial it is, most students just think short term, but in reality that tiny bit of information can lead them to fully understanding and memorizing the topic and getting them set up for a lifetime of goals and achievements.";0
"Over summer break, some schools have their students do projects so then they can keep their brains trained over the period of time they are away from school. These projects are beneficial for students to keep learning throughout their summer break. The question here lies in whether these projects should be designed by the teachers or by the students. Some people think that if it is teacher designed, then it will give students more incentive to get the projects done. That is not the case for most students in this day and age. Summer projects should be designed by students because it will allow students to do the projects they are actually interested in, motivate these students to do their projects, and allow students to move at their own pace.

Whenever students are given the chance to be creative with what they are doing in school, they get really excited about it. If we start doing that with these summer projects, they will want to do them and have fun with it instead of it being forced onto them. It will give them something to look forward to working on, not something they are just drudging through in order to get an A on it. When students are forced to do something they do not want to do, it will give them even more of a reason to not do it. If they got to choose what subject they want to do for these summer projects, it will make them more interested in doing it.

Students these days see summer break as a cool off period to start a new year. Some spend their time just sitting around and using this time to relax or spend time with friends and have fun. Then they get hit with these gigantic projects that they do not want to spend their summer doing. If these projects were student led then it will make students more motivated to actually finish them. If they were led by teachers, then students would just procrastinate until the last minute and go into the school year stressed about the grade they got for it. Then it would make their mentality starting the new year lowered.

Most students learn at a different pace compared to others. So if you make each student do the same exact projects as each other, then it won't be tailored to one individual student. Then they would lose interest in it and not do the project. If you want students to succeed, then you should make a system where they have more freedom to do things that intrigue them instead of making them have to fit a certain mold. If they are allowed to make their own decisions with what they are learning, then they will start being motivated to do their work.

While some schools allow their students to decide what summer project they do, there are other schools that are more strict about it and have the teachers making all the decisions on someones education. This is an unhealthy way to educate children by not letting them express their creativity and not letting them think outside of the box. If we don't let students use their imagination, they would become carbon copies of one another and that is not how education should be. While some argue that teachers should control projects, the healthier alternative is to give students that option instead so they could be more motivated.";0
"Having ""electors"" vote for us from the electoral college is basically giving us, the people, no say into what we president we want. Why ask us the people to vote when you have someone or others to chose what they think we want for president? Changing the from electoral college voting to the popular vote can give us the people a voice for what we want and think is best for this country and it gives us a reason to vote. If we still electoral college voting then our voice as a country is not being heard.

Giving us a voice in this country that we live in an enormous oppurtunity than what other countries around the world do not have the privelage to have. Giving us, the people, a voice brings us together as a country and it unifies us. It also means that not only do we have governent power but we have people power as a whole. Bradford Plumer from source 2 explains to us in his first subtitle what is wrong withe the electoral college and he startes that ""When you vote, you are not voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors, who then for the president of their choice."" That was an example of our people not having a voice because we are basically wasting our time voting because at the end of the day the slate of electors are the ones who end up chosing who they want as president. Why should we vote when our vote doesn't even matter?

Moreover, I feel that us voting is a waste of our time because of this winner-takes-all method that Bradford Plumer states in the fifth paragraph of his article titled: The Indefensible Electoral College. The winner-takes-all method is when presidents travel to specific states in which they believe they would win in the electoral votes and some states do not get visited at all by neither of the canidates because the canidates do not feel like they would win their votes. I understand that the electoral college is a process in which was founded by our founding fathers and established it into our constitution so that there is a compromise between election of the presodent by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Source 1). It is not really a compromise when you have a system in which a president can win the popular vote by 99 percent of the people but still lose by the electoral college because we basically have no say in the election.

On a final note, the electoral college system is a unfair way of our countries presidents to be elected when we also have the votes of the people which have no effect on which canidate wins. Although, our founding fathers thought this was a terrific idea at the time of making this part of the constitution, in reality we have a much larger population today than they did in the past when they had made the constitution. Having have all these people in our country vote today for a canidate and later have the vote not take any effect which canidate should win is very unfair. I can understand the electoral college system working back then when it was first made because the population was still relatively minimal but now we must abolish it because the points that some electoral vote colleges get is very small compared to some other states. How would you feel if you were a canidate and got 99.9 percent of the votes and still lost?    ";0
"Cells Phones have an affect on everyone's life.People use their cell phone for almost everything such as:texting,talking,planning things,etc.Some people can do a lot with their cell phone in their hand.Everyone is always focused on their phone because phones are important to everyone.Being on cell phones while driving is a serious safety risk.

When your on your cell phone while driving you forget that your driving because your trying to text.Being on cell phones while driving is not safe you can have a car crash and hurt the other person you hit.Most of Car crashes come from when people on their phone and not paying attention to driving.It is very dangerous for everyone if you be on your cell phone while driving.

Drivers should not be allowed to be on cell phones while driving.Drivers try to drive and text at the same time and that's how people get hurt.If drivers are not allowed to use their phone it will help to not have so many accidents.Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things to do on the road.Any distracted driving can get you in accident because your not focused on driving.

Texting and driving is just like drinking and driving it's very dangerous.Everyday it's a car accident most of the time it's because somebody is texting and driving.Some drivers can text and drive without being in a car accident but it's still not safe for the people who were in the car with and the people on the road.It's all ages texting and driving not just teens and not just adults.

Texting and driving shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the world.It's a danger to everyone it should be banned.People get hurt and killed from car crashes.Texting while driving is a choice and people should pick the safest thing to do when driving and texting while driving is not safe at all.That's my opinion for texting and driving.

"I think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. First it could interfear with there scedule, second it could get in the way of school and lastly it could induce stress.

First the childs scedule. Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.

Second it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.

Third is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress. The activites could cause the child to lost sleep and that could leave the child tired and stressed for the rest of there school day. Next it could cause to much stress and that can lead to unwanted sideffects, like hair lost pail coloring of skin, hair loss and suicidal thoughts which isnt good.

Thats whyI think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. ";0
"Dear Principal,

I think you should let students used their cell phones during free periods. It would give them a chance to relax and talk to their friends while they can without being next to them. Also, it will give them more responsibility to turn off their phones when their free time is over. The students would be happier and be able to express themselves more if they were able to choose to use their phones.

Everyone likes to talk to their friends when they can. Letting students use their phones in school would let them do that. They would not have to be right next to the other person and they would be able to ask about school things if they needed to like homework and class work. Also, students would be able to get all of their talking out of the way so they are focused for when they go back to class. Other kids who are trying to be rude to people texting and talking to their friends on their phone would not be able to get into the conversation and get the other person upset.

It would be a big responsibility to have phones in school. Students would be able to use them during any free period they want as long as they got turned off when they got back to class. This would help teach responsibility more because there would be less phones getting taken away. Teachers would also get to see if their students would follow the rules and turn their phones off. Also, if students had to turn their phones off and they did, there would be less phones getting sunk into the classroom and used.

You can tell a lot about a person by the amount of time they use their phones. Some use them every chance they get, and some barely use their phones. Students at school would be able to express themselves more by being able to use their phones and the teachers would be able to know who they are better.

Girls and boys would be happier and even make more friends at school better then they were able to before. They'd be able to relate to other people more. There would possibly be less bullying because they wouldn't be able to see other peoples' conversations and make fun of them for what they say to their friends.

Students at schools always use their phones. If they were able to use them during free periods, they would be more relaxed and able to talk to their friends more often, it would teach them responsibility to turn their phones off when they go back to class, and they would be happier and able to express themselves more in school.

Mr. senator i think we should get rid of the electoral college and change to popular votefor the presidency. I know im not even old enough to vote yet and your probably thinking what is this kid talking about but i dont think it is right to vote for the president of the united states canidate and really not even vote for him. The electoral college should vote for us because believe it or not it isnt always the right desicion sometimes. They say people of age and an american citazen that we can vote then let them vote for who they want they shouldnt have to vote really for an elector people want to feel like there vote matters. The peoples votes should go right to the box and count the votes and see who wins. The electoral college is of no need for the election process we the people can vote for ourselfs please just let us. And i know it isnt really in the writing format the way they want it i just want you to know my oppinoin and i know your probably going to just skim right over this but please if you have the time just please read over this and take the time to understand were im coming from.    ;0
"Online classes have become a popular option for students in recent years, offering flexibility and convenience that traditional classroom settings cannot match. However, like any other educational approach, online learning has its pros and cons. In this essay, I will evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes online, identify the difficulties students may face in this environment, analyze the impact of online learning on students, and examine the potential pitfalls of attending online classes.

One of the significant pros of attending classes online is the flexibility it offers. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, at any time of the day or night, as long as they have a stable internet connection. This is particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules, such as athletes, musicians, or those who work part-time jobs. Online classes also provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace, which can be particularly helpful for those who need extra time to understand complex concepts.

Another advantage of online classes is the access to a wider range of courses. Students who live in remote areas or those who cannot access traditional classrooms due to financial or geographical constraints can benefit from online classes. Additionally, online classes can provide students with access to renowned instructors and experts from around the world, which can broaden their knowledge and perspectives.

However, attending classes online also has its difficulties. One of the significant challenges is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers. This can make it harder for students to build relationships and collaborate with their peers, which can negatively impact their learning experience. Moreover, online classes can be isolating, and students may feel disconnected from their peers and instructors, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.

Another difficulty students may face in online classes is the distractions that come with learning from home. Students may find it challenging to stay focused and avoid distractions such as television, social media, and household chores. Additionally, students may struggle with time management, which can lead to missed deadlines and poor performance in classes.

The online learning environment can also have a significant impact on students' motivation and engagement. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may find it harder to stay motivated and engaged in their learning. Moreover";1
"The Debate of the Faces

A new technology called Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to show human emotions by facial expressions, is not valuable to students in the classroom. I do not think that a computer system to read the emotions of students is needed for a quality education. Students have been learning in schools without the Facial Action Coding System for hundreds of years, so why would the Facial Action Coding System help us now? The Facial Action Coding System could actually be unbeneficial to students in the long run. This system could make students feel uncomfortable and insecure about their learning.

The main reason that the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom is beause it is invading to the students privacy. The students may feel like their emotions are invaded by a computer that is constantly watching them. The Facial Action Coding System could make the student feel like they are being pressured and that their emotions for a certain day can alter their learning style. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"" (D'Alto). This shows that the system can watch the students' every move. Would you like to be watched all day by a computer that is reading your mood?

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System is not needed in the classroom is because many classes in school are taught by a teacher, not by computers. The Facial Action Coding System might not be used at all if the school is taught by a majority of teachers, which could be a waste of money and software. Dr. Huang says in paragraph 6 that 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Even though this statement is true about the Facial Action Coding System, many lessons in schools are not taught by computers, but are taught by teachers. The teacher could also probably tell if the students are bored or confused so they could alter their lessons. In paragraph 5, the author says that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto). This shows that the classroom teacher could effectively alter their lesson based on the expressions of the students, just as the Facial Action Coding System could.

In some cases the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to the classroom and learning environment. If a student is taking online courses or a school is predominantly taught by computer lessons, the Facial Action Coding System would help students stay more focused. The system could try to change the way of teaching based on the viewer's expressions. The system can also be beneficial to ads on computers. ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto). This shows that the Facial Action Coding System could also make ads more interesting for those on computers often.

The Facial Action Coding System is definetly an amazing invention to computers and reading facial expressions. Although it is a great invention, I do not think that schools are ready for a program that studies the students' faces. This technology should not be used so it can protect the students' privacy, make them feel comfortable in the learning environment, and make them feel like their lessons are not forced. Many schools are also probably still taught by a majority of teachers, whearas the Facial Action Coding System would not be needed at all. All in all, it depends on where you fall in the debate of the faces.";0
"Dear principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i believe that if you change the schools average grade level from a C to a B it will be catastrophic because many people cant focus on being at school for 7 to 8 hours having math, social studies, language art, and science class then they have to do all of there homework for those classes that would mean that they would have to do 2 to 3 hours of homework after practice or games, which can take up to 2 or 3 hours so it will 5 to 6 even 7 o'clock until some people get home and then having to do 2 to 3 hours of homework on top of that many students wont be going to bed until 10 to 11 o'clock at night and doctors say that kids and teens from ages 9-18 need about 9 hours of sleep a night to be healthy young adults and do good in school. Also if you have the change and the grade level is an average B many students might not get to play sports because they only have a grade average of a C and do you really think it's fair to those students that don' get that opportunity to play sports?";0
"An extended school day can have both positive and negative effects on student life. On the positive side, extra hours could lead to improved academic performance. Students would have more time to complete assignments, receive extra help from teachers, or even attend additional academic or extracurricular activities. In addition, the long days may provide students with a sense of structure and purpose that can be difficult to beat at home.

On the other hand, adding hours to a student's school schedule can be a considerable strain, leading to fewer opportunities for leisure or extracurricular activities. It can also lead to increased fatigue, anxiety, or distraction. Additionally, students with already-busy schedules may find it difficult to fit the extra hours into their day-to-day lives. 

Ultimately, the decision to add more hours to the school day should be taken carefully, and should address the particular needs of the student body. Increased hours could be beneficial if balanced properly with additional, restorative activities; however, the long hours of a fully packed schedule can be difficult for many students to manage. Ultimately, adding extra hours should be done with consideration for the impact on the student's academic performance, extracurricular activities, and overall quality of life.";1
"Dear Senator,

I believe that we should keep the electoral college. Although they maybe known to be unfair, outdated, irrational, and an non-democractic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But I believe it is fair because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between electon of the president by a vote of congress and election of the prsident by a popular vote of qualified citizens and that when we vote we vote for electors who basically take the side of the peoples voice but do further research on the two people that are running for president and vice president. and the electoral college requires a presodential to have transregional appeal so that there won't be a solid region that has one favorite canidate because a canidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president and the other region will feel that thier votes won't count and that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he rally isn't their president. the electoral college restores some of the weight i the political balance that larger states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution and avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast whcih makes the electoral college a better and more fair way of voting.            ";0
"If you were able to attend school from home that would't be the best choice, and the reasons why is cause you would be getting lazy and you would e getting used to that laziness, for me i rather go to school to actually learn and not at home cause i know for sure im going to slack off most of the time,

Being home schooled would sound nice but depending on the things that your learning, You can start class any time when your being home schooled, i mean hey i dont want to wake up early to go to a public school i mean no kid wants to wake up early just for that, being home schooled is nice cause you can do whatever you want while doing work, waking up late wouldnt be bad it would sound nice, students being home schooled have some lack of education cause they got used to becoming lazy and not doing anything theres no teacher to tell him/her what to do they can do whatever they want with no teacher to bother them.

but over all attending to being home school wouldnt sound to bad but being home schooled is expansive isnt it ? compaered to a public school..........

"Do you ask people for advice? Asking different people for advice can help you see from multiple points of views, some times we talk to more than one person. having different opinions can help yourself make a better choice than an horrible choice.

I think everybody should ask for advice and give advice. A lot of people should be nice enough to give advice and those people reciving the advice should listen very carefully to them, getting advice could be helpful. If your a kid reciving advice from an grown up you should most definitly listen because an adult know more than what we know so yaÃÂ´ll should listen carefully.

Having multipl opinions is good because if one doesnÃÂ´t go as plan than you can have several to fall back on instead of having just one when you can having several more to follow to. Everybody is going to need advice at some in time maybe not now but later you are going to need it. Taking advice will not be as easy as it seems, some times it may be easy other times it may be hard taking it in.

Asking different people for advice can help you see from multiple points of views, Everybody should ask for advice. Having multiple opinions is a good thing. Ask for advice every time you need it, thatÃÂ´s why people are here to help you they just wanna know your problem or whatÃÂ´s happened in your life, if you need help passing a class, getting up for work and you have no car, people can help you, advice can help you se more clearly of your situation to get out of it so just ask them for advice anytime you need it.";0
"Dear the so called ""principal"" D=<

Maybe your just worrying that we won't have good grades for doing sports, but having a ""B"" average to do extra activities is just plain ridiculous. >:(

First of all, a ""C"" is marked AVERAGE anyways, so its still a decent grade, and its what your SUPPOSED to get. Having Ds or Fs, i would understand that you will not allow them to go into sports or extra activities, because that's BELOW average. Gut the C average should be the limit!

Also if the majority of the students have a C average, then their WON'T be a lot of students doing activities, do you REALLY want to take that away from them? That's also affecting their future. (It's obvious I'm trying to make you feel guilty) but I think you deserve it ""principle"". =_=

Maybe you just want them to try harder. (which is also ridiculous because I'm pretty sure that every student tries their very best.) But doing these things won't make kids try harder at all. Nope. In fact, it just makes them angrier, (You can tell by the tone I'm using haha...)

and not want to try at all. It just ENCOURAGES them not to try. These are the kinds of stuff that makes kids not like school.

Why won't you see that? >:(

"Voting is one of the hardest choices a person has to make because in reality the votes for the american perident can be decided by one or two votes sometimes. The two deciding factors in voting are the electoral college and the popular vote of the people. They both make the elections fair but also unfair. Without one the whole election process would not be as good as it is today.

The Electoral College is comprised of a total of 538 electors and to elect a president you need a majority of 270 votes from the 538. This electoral college is comprised of one vote for each representative from your state plus two for the senators. Obviously this gives every state a fair chance to vote but even if lets say Hawaii, North Dakota, and South Dakota wanted republican and Texas wanted democrat Texas' votes would cancel out the others because of the amount of representatives they have compared to the other three states. This is one thing that makes this form of voting very unfair. Obviously it is smart to give somestates more representatives because of their population but that completly defeats the purpose of making it fair because the small states stand no chance against the densely populated ones like Florida, Texas, California, and New York.

The popular vote is the percentage of votes that the president recieves form the people, citizens that are voting for them. The popular vote does not haver as much effect as the Electoral College but it still does make an effect. For example in 2000 when Al Gore had 60% of the popular vote but did not win the presidency because George Bush had the majority of the Electoral College. This is when the popular vote should be more emphasized because obviously the people which is over about 20 Million wanted Gore but the Electoral College vote of more than only 270 people wanted Bush. That is an issue but also some people voting don't really understand what the two people are offering and just vote because one sounds better, looks cooler, your friends are voting for him/her. This is why the popular voting system cannot be fully trusted.

The compare the two topics not one is better than the other and not one can fuction woithout the other. In my perspective it was smart of the founding fathers to create both systems so that the voting would be somewhat fair. In reality even though the popular vote doesn't make a difference it can persuade the representatives of the state to change their mind or it can make them realize that they are making the right decision because of how their state is chosing to vote. This should change their mind because the people elected them knowing that they will vote for who they promised to vote for and will most likely stay true to their state and to their party.

In conclusion both system are great together but apart cannot funcion. The founding fathers and leaders of this country cannot be blamed for making this system because there is really no way to make it fair and they did their best to do so. Now think if you were to design the voting system for the United States of America what woudl you do differently or the same.    ";0

March 12, 2020

Do you think every body should do a extra curricular activity? Most people do activities but the school does not run them. A lot of schools dont even host good our a lot of programs. Most activities do not fit every body. After school things separate more time away from peoples family.

If someone makes the team for a sport over a kid who wants it more then that person. The student that made it gets forced to do something he docent want to do, and ruins opportunities for other kids. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.

Kids who really want's something might not be able to achieve there goal. They put in extra work and grinding for along time. Some kids might just be there to say they are on a team or program. If every one had to do one extra activity things would get packed. They have been trying there best for a lot of years and just join something for free.

People love to have freedom they like to go home play with there dog our younger siblings. next there some kids that like play video games and make money from that. Forcing kids do an activity might make sad if they get joked cause they do something wrong. Not every body parents or guardians can come pick the up after school. Theres a lot of kids out there like to do activities by them selves because it helps them focus.

Finally kids are passionate about there own activities. Having to do another activity can make some students irritated. Students are already at school for seven plus hours. Kids should follow there dreams stick to it and make new things happen.

Students would like to pro sue there own path.

At last this is why having extracurricular activities is not he brightest idea. Hope that this will put an idea principle thought. Having to do extra activity when just make the day if longer. They want to go home and live there life how they want to. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.                                ";0
"Dear Senator,

The Presidential Election is one of the most important events that goes on in the United States. At the core of this election is the Electoral College. The only problem is, the college has many flaws. Like in Source 1, it states that our Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote from the citizens who qualify. As you know the E.C consists of the selection of electors, meeting of electors where they vote for the President and Vice, and the counting of the votes by Congress. There are 538 electors, 538 votes, and it takes a majority of 270 votes to win the election. This flawed system has been around too long and it needs to be altered. I am in favor of getting rid of the E.C and going to winner by a popular vote.

If the Presidential candidate is favored by more than 50% of the country then he or she should win. Like in Source 2 history shows that in the past candidates have clearly won the popular vote, but sill lost the presidency race. The problem with the current system we have in place is that the people who are supposed to have a direct voice in the government do not. Instead the people vote for other people who they are supposed to trust vote in favor of their opinion. I can see how some people believe in this system of trust, however some history has shown us otherwise.

History has shown that electors can go against the opinion of the public. When you vote for electors most of the time they in turn vote for what the people want. The only thing is you are not ensured that this will occur. In the end it is up to the elector who can decide however they wish. Personally for the U.S. it would be more effective to go to winner by popular vote, not only because of the unsureness of the electors, but also because that is what the people want. Another valid arguement to get rid of the whole Electoral College process is in Source 2, it states that sometimes voters get confused with the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. That could be detrimental to the country if the wrong person for the job was elected. If it was the popular vote sytem the selection of candidates would be clear and easy to understand, which leads to less mistakes when voting.

The view of getting rid of the Electoral College is actually quite popular. In Source 2 it tells us Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and others have all agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College. Going all the way back to the beginning of our country we started off on the base priciple that the people must have a direct voice in the government. That is the reason our country was made a democracy. The Electoral College has bent those principles and hasn't fully allowed the voice of the people to be heard. With the popular vote put in place their are no middle men, it is just the people voicing what they want and who they want to represent them.

Looking over the information that has been presented it is clear that the Electoral College has to go. The system is flawed for many reasons such as the popular candidate not winning, voices not being ensured that they will be heard, and the confusing system of not voting directly for your President. If the change of winner by popular vote in the election is made none of the previous flaws will be present. The popular vote sytem will ensure the people get what they want and the process is completely fair. For these reasons it is in our society's best interest that our government makes this change. Abolish the Electoral College and bring on a new age of simple and fair elections!

From,

A concerned citizen.                                            ";0
"Dear principle,

I believe that policy 1 is the better choice. I believe that policy 1 is the better choice because students should have some freedom in school. If a student was using there cell phone in the class room this student should get there cell phone back after class is over. IF there cell phone makes a noise with the teacher is talking, while students are taking a test, or if the cell phone just makes noise in class the student should be reminded that all cell phone should be turned on silent during your class times. School should not be like a prison to children. School years for a child growing into an adult should be the best years of there life not the worst. The students should have there rights about be about to have a say in certain things.

If some student in the class room gets extremely hurt like brakes an arm the students should be able to call that students parents and call 911 if needed.

These are just a few reasons why i believe that policy 1 is a better choice than policy 2.";0
"Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn't have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name's alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, ""Are you on your way to football practice?"" ""Unfortunately,"" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn't bad at football, he just didn't enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn't because too many people who didn't want to participate signed up. ""How's the student council?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,"" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn't have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn't enjoy it as much because those who didn't want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn't have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren't interesting to them. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.

The first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students' after school activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after school activities.

Another reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they're being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won't be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn't interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren't provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don't wish to participate.

In addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don't want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you're on a team, whether it's a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn't putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who's not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they're interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyable if a student doesn't participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.

Generic_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team's effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. ""Guess what?"" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. ""What?"" Generic_Name replied curiously. ""I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!"" ""Congratulations, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, ""See you later, Generic_Name."" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn't have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team's effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.";0
"The Advantages to Limiting Car Usage

Cars are a typical necessity for everyday life, not just in the United States, but worldwide. However, I propose a simple theory; are cars really a necessity? A question as simple as this, could possibly change the world. I believe that if we lived in a car-free world, we would have more advantages than disadvantages. That it would change the world as we know it.

To begin, the elimination of personal motorized vehicles will save a magnanimous amount of money. As a flooring illustration, in source one paragraph 9, the Federal Transportation bill is called out. Ashtonishingly, 80% of appropriations have gone to the manitainance and construction of highways.  In addition, gas prices are at thier all time highest. On average, one of my parents spends eighty dollars a week on a single vehichle. A car free world will not only save an individual thousands of dollars each year, but will save our country millions of dollars which could be used in areas of more necessity.

As a second example, land is a precious resource that is currently endangered. Source one paragraph six has started a community that is practically, car-free. It packed 5,500 residents within a square mile. One might wonder how this is possible. The answer is quite obvious, with the elimintation of vehicles, the need for parking, driveways, and garages was unnecessary, therfore making it a possibility for so many people to live in a single square mile.

Finally, the elimination of vehicles will increase the healthiness of our enviorment. To illustrate, in Paris, the smog is so overwhelming, the decrease of car use was demanded. As a result of less use, the smog drastically decreased and on top of that, congestion was down 60% (Source 2 ¶14). It is also a common fact that transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions (Source 4 ¶34). Obviously, the elimination of vehicles will increase our enviroments stability drastically.

In conclusion, cars are over used and relied on too heavily. The peak for motorized vehicles has ended and it is time to fix the damage we created. We will save our envoirment, our money, and our precious resource, land by simply eliminating cars. So, is it really a necessity?                           ";0
"dear state senator

Over the years many people have complained that voting for a president of the united states is unfair. That they fell that someting should be done to change the voting system. In the articals given to me i have read some resons to keep it and to abolish it. In source one the electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers astablished it in the constitution as a compromise between elections. For the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors but if a majority is 270 electoral votes. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pourposes of the electoral college. You are choosing an electors when you vote for president because when you vote for a canidate u a really voting for your candidate's electors. There are some little things that need to be done to fix it a little like fir example the part thats stats that smaller states have barly no power and that most presedents dont even wory about then becuse they don't make muche of a difrance. Each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarly betrayed). The other problen that is with this system is that the winer takes all when the are may poeple that vote for ether for the republican or democratic if the oponunt has more votes they won all the electors and the oponunt does not get any votes from that state so its like you didin't even vote. If it was up to me to keep the electoral callege system i would say yes but they just have to make some few changes.

"Some people like to imagine the unreal, so when a mysterious face figure was spotted on Cydonia the public blew up. Outsiders, some of them at least, thought it had something to do with aliens and a conspiracy theory, but NASA didn't seem to agree and thought it was nothing but a landform and a picture taken at the right time.

Even thought the figure does seem quite mysterious doesn't mean it's and acient alien artifact. Becuase of technlogy and how cameras dont always capture what really there. For instance, ever taken a picture of a sunset and the colors didn't look the exact same as they did in person, well, this might be the same case. ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face."" The camera might have taken the picture in a way that the human eye couldn't see. It might have added extra, or inhanced shadows making it look like a face. You'd also have to think about the angle the picture was taken in. Maybe in person from a different angle it looked like nothing but a rock, but when a picture is taken and the shadows have changed it looks like a real face with eyes, a nose and even a mouth.

Meanwhile back down on planet earth some people may be going insane and think that this has something do to with aliens and a conspiracy theory. There is no proof that the landform has anything to do with aliens except for its odd shape. Since there is no known life on Cydonia people don't know what type of strange weather or temperature changes they could've had that effected the shape of it. People tend to think what they want to believe and not look at the facts. They like to ignore whats really there and think what they want to think to create some type of excitment in their life. ""It has starred ina Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" Then when a small amount of people started to think this had something to do with aliens more people started to believe also, and thats when it went viral.

However, since no one has been down to see the strange landform nobody can confirm that it is either just a landform or an alien artifact. And it is a strange looking figure and sort of unexplainable so I can see why people first thought it had to do with a conspricy theory. But there are more reasons for it to be nothing but a landform rather than an artifact. The best thing to do is look at the facts and not believe what you want to believe just because it is exciting.

In conclusion, as exciting as it would be for this is odd looking figure to be, or have anything to do with aliens, it's nothing but a landform that looks like an alien face. And because of technolgy and peoples creative minds its features were inhanced and made to look real. You can think what you want and believe what you want, but look at the facts, it was nothing but a mere photographed mistake.      ";0
"Dear principal,

From these two polices given i am agreeing more on having no cell phones at school at all. kids that bring there phones are most likely to lose or get there phone stolen. Then that is making all the school administrators take there time to look for there phone, but if they have not brought it to school in the first place then that wouldn't have been a problem.

Bringing a phone to school could never be a great idea because they would end being broken, stole, or they just make people focus less if they have them with it.

When some one brings a phone they'll end up playing games during the middle of class when the teacher isn't watching. Then the person sitting beside him might want to play and end up making him miss some important information from the teacher. When this happens the student would might end up failing a quiz or test all because of the distraction of the phone.

Most of the time i see some person playing or texting on there phone. Which i find really distracting, and there's noting i can do to stop them unless move to another spot. Phones could also hold answers to a quiz or a test. That person can easily take there phone out when the teacher isn't looking and cheat. That's one of the big problems with phones people cheating.

Some people might say phones are helpful in school because of all the little helpful tools that are built into the phone. For example some one who needs a calculator wouldn't need to worry on bring or borrowing some one else's when they have one on there phone. A couple student might require there phone for when they get home to call there parents and tell them there all right. Or if something goes wrong in school or at home they could easily call for help right away.

Now that iv listened some of the resons why phones shouldn't be alowed at school is all up to you know. i still personally think having phones at school shouldn't be alowed. Due to all the distraction      ";0
"Humans have taken extreme measures to achieve their goal of landing on the moon. At the time, many people did not believe that it was ever going to be possible. Today, many astronaut have successfully landed on the moon. The challenge of exploring Venus is another one of these cases that some humans believe is possible, but others do not. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains how scientists today strive to meet this challenge and take it on, even after knowing the chaotic conditions of Venus, in order gain insight on the planet as well as to stifle their own curiosity.

The ""Evening Star"", or the planet Venus has extremely dangerous surface and atmospheric conditions for humans to explore, but in many ways has similar features to Earth as well. One of the main reasons humans would not be able to survive a trip to Venus's surface without the proper equipment is because the average surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of this, Venus has the hottest surface temperature out of all of the other planets. Another aspect of the dangerous conditions of Venus's surface is that it has frequently-errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Thes conditions would be dangerous for humans if they were on the surface for to long. These are some of the reasons why past attempts of exploration were unsuccessful.

Even though Venus has many dangerous conditions on the surface, there are also many landforms that make it comparable to Earth. Some of these are a scatter of valleys, mountains, and craters. Scientists also believe that Venus used to be covered with vast oceans and potentially could have supported various forms of life.

Even though there are so many components, surface conditions are not the only chaotic feature of the ""Evening Star"". The atmosphere of Venus is also extremely dangerous for humans to surpass. The clouds are filled with corrosive sulfuric acid and the atmosphere is dense with 97% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what is experienced on Earth. These extreme conditions make it far too dangerous for human to explore. To resolve this issue, scientists at NASA today have begun to innovate ideas to find a way to successfully send humans to observe the features of Venus.

One of the approaches NASA is taking to the problem is to simulate Venus's surface conditions in order to test different engineered materials to see how well they withstand the constant heat and pressure. Another approach that the scientists have researched is flying a ""blimp-like vehicle"" about 30 miles about the surface of Venus to avoid having to land on the scorching surface. This method had many plusses because the ""solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels"".

Just like there are many plusses that come this idea, there are also a few negatives. Because flying higher than 30 miles above the surface is one of the only options in getting close enought to observe, the distance will cause ""limited insight on ground conditions"". The thick atmosphere would prevent photography to be clear and decipherable. Another negative is that the scientists have no way to collect any samples from the surface for evidence. Flying above the atmosphere would get the astronauts close, but it would be ineffective.

Each day, scientist work hard to come up with new materials and ideas to achieve their goal to successsfully explore Venus. Even though there are many dangers because of the harsh atmospheric and surface conditions, scientists and astronauts work towards this goal because they are determined and believe it is possible to overcome these obstacles to get to what they've worked hard for.

"Many people would agree that technology plays a huge part in their everyday life. Technology has advanced drastically in the past decades. It changes the way we communicate, the way we drive, and the way we gain information. Technology is even changing the way school systems teach kids. This change is not only coming from inside the school but outside the school also. Offering online classes to students is more common now than ever. Schools should not offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home because they will not be motivated enough, it will be easier to cheat, and it exploits you from necessary social interaction.

Teens are not motivated as it is. The teenager years are very stressful because these are the years you are transforming from kids to adults. This is the time when your ""fight or flight"" cuts on. When stressed teens have a pile of homework to do, it is less likely for them to fight through it instead of pushing it off to the next day. That is unless they have people pushing them to get their work done. In an ordinary classroom, it is really embarrassing when you are the only one that did not do your homework. You often ask around the classroom to see if anyone else forgot to do it or you rush to do it so nobody notices. Students who do online classes are in an environment they are comfortable in and do not feel pushed. They will be able to do their work at their own pace, but a teen's pace is not fast enough to succeed.

Think about how many students cheat when a teacher is hovering over them; the answer is none. Students are less compelled to do right on their own. Like mentioned before, these are the years were teens are not kids but are not necessarily adults. As a student, you do not think about actually gaining the information, you just think getting a good grade. This could result in students looking up answers on their phone, using the textbook when they are not suppose to, and calling up friends for the answers. It will be harder to crack down on cheating if the school system gives students responsibility that they can not handle.

School is not only the place where students learn, but it is also the place where they make friends. If the school system was to create distance learning an option, they would be depriving students from social interaction. Creating these bonds is necessary for good mental and emotional health. Without these connections, it would be harder to communicate and make personal relationships when entering the real world. Many say that online schooling could prevent negative things such as bullying. If online school is one of the best options to prevent bullying then the school system has bigger problems to focus on than making distance learning an option. School is a part of preparing kids for adulthood, so it would not make sense to let them hide behind a computer screen.

While technology is one of the best advancements ever made, there is such thing as too far. Bringing school into people's homes should not be an option because students are not motivated enough, it will be easier to cheat, and it gives less chances of social interaction. While our school system has been strengthened through easy access to computers, technology should not take over the school system because it will deprive us from lesson needed to succeed in adulthood. ";0
"Dear principal, you have recently decided to change the policy for school sports, and that has upset many students. I understand your logic in changing the rule but would like to ask you to reconsider. Sport contribute to the lives of many students , and help them develop social skills. I know your logic for changing the rule is so that the students will get better grades, but what if a C is the best they can do? There are many student that can't make a B even when they are trying their best. If you tell a hardworking student that they can't play sports because of their grades they will begin to work less. Some students might take offence in the fact that they were trying their best and you said they could not play sports anymore.

Some students might use sports as a way to escape a bad home life. Others might use it to help with anger problems. Sports means so much to so many people that if you take it away from them just because they have a C they will feel as if they lost a part of themselves.

If you are worried about students grades falling just remind them that you want a C or better. If a C is the best you can do then you shouldn't be punished for that. Students need to be reminded that if they do their best they will be reworded. One of those rewards is letting them play sports even when they have a C.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I hope you will take this into consideration before you change the rule.

Respectful, STUDENT_NAME";0
"The Electoral College has made everything easier on people. They keep votes fair, clear and concise and make them uncomplicated. Although there are some against the idea, the benifits outweigh the detriments immensly.

Bradford Plumer author of ""

The Indefensible Electoral College

"" insists that ""the electoral college is unfair to voters""(source 2 paragraph 13). This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway. It gives a simple vote to people and produces a clear winner. Also he states that ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""(p.12) He thinks that one representitive cant speak for his region, but thats why they vote right? He represents the majority supplimenting a clear representation of his state/region.

Also Collumist Richard Posner implies that the Electoral College has ""a presidential canidate [that has] trans-regional appeal"" (Source 3 paragraph 19). So the presidential cannidate can be based off a full region or more, not just a few states. This makes the vote obvious and is a more fair vote. Also the Office of Federal Register tells us there are 538 electors with a 270 majority int the Electoral College(Source 1 paragraph 3). Not only is there great variety present but with many votes they make the result concise.

Not only is the Electoral College making votes concise and fair, also it is currently working. Bradford Plumer states ""The electoral college is...outdated""(Source 2 paragraph 14). How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Fedral Register informs us ""You help choose you state's electors when you vote for your president""(Source 1 paragraph 6). This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in goverment.

Even though there are many counter-claims, the benifits surely outweigh the detriments. Its nearly a perfect system. The fair, multifarious choices, and clear voting of the Electoral college proves it deserves it's stay in the goverment.    ";0
"In 1945, World War ll had just ended. 44 countries joined to create the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration. The UNRRA is an administration that helps a country that has lost quite a bit in the war. The UNRRA helped countries that lost food supply, animal supply, and more. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to help care for the horses, young cows, and mule that were going to be shiped to other countries.

I think that there are many reasons that people should join the UNRRA. The first reason that I have provided for you is that This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The second reason I have is because even though you will be working you will be able to spend time with animals and you will see many sites that you would not have seen if you would have stayed home. The third reason I will provide is that not many people can do big oversea trips like that, a lot of people get very seasick. My final reason is that you would know you would be helping innocent people. You would know this because not everybody is in on these wars in fact most people are not in on big wars because they know it will tear apart their family.

I think that there are some claims that Luke has made that I should share. I think that one of Luke's claims that I should share is he said, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."". I think that he could support this because a lot of people, families, homes, and countries are destroyed and seperated. Another of Luke's claims was, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Accropolis in Greece was special."" I think that this can be supported because this would be truely amazing. I think that he did a good thing to choose to help the UNRRA, but being able to see Europe, China, and Greece would be incredible.

I think that Luke was a very incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"". I think that some details to suppot this are that he lasted 9 trips to nine different countries. This is incredible because that is the longest any ""Seagoing Cowboy"" has ever lasted. I think another reason he is an incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"" is because he decided to help the UNRRA. I bet that at the begining he was extremely nervous and I bet that he wanted to go home to his mom, dad, and siblings if he had any. My last reason that he was incredible is that he kept working even if he got seasick, or if he wanted to go home. I think that work was one thing that he used to get his mind off of things he worried about.

There are some thing that he could've done on the positive and the negative side. First, on the positive side, I thinkthat if he really set his mind to it he could've been a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" for at least 10-12 trips. I think that some benefits to staying longer would be that you would've been able to do more sight seeing, also you would've been able to spend more time with the animals. One thing that would be negative is that he would've gotten seasick more times than without staying.

I think that I would've signed up for this opportunity because I love animals and I really like being on the ocean. I think that this would be a great chance. I think that they should have things like this in 2016. I think that there are a lot of countries that could use something like this, one that I can think of off the top of my head is Syria. They could use all the help they could get, they could use food, shelter, animal products, and animals in general. I think that I would think the same way as Luke. I think that me and my friends would all sign up and we would do everything together. We would care for the animals together, we would eat together, we would sightsee together, and lastly we would take breaks and stop together. My overall thought is that this would be great but it would also be extremely dangerous.";0
"Cars have been used and started to rise since World War II. Vehicles have trended to make them fit our life and culture. But there has been so many tragic events taking place because of the use of cars and people debates whether cars should be used or not. It will be a great idea to limit cars because it will protect the environment, cut difficulties while on the road and improve safety and business.

Initially, it would be a great option to limit cars because it will protect the environment. Cars are used to make it easier to transport places but it does not help protect the world around. Cars cause damage to the whole atmosphere and can harm many. For instance, in Paris, people are fined for driving because of the smog polluted in the air. According to the passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. The use of driving vehicles can make it difficult to live in the world.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars will be a big advantage to the world because it can cut difficulties while on the road. The less use of cars will lead to better circumstances while on the road. It will be easier for buses or delivery trucks to do their tasks quicker and more efficient. For example, in Bogota, many parks and sports centers have been replaced with smooth sidewalks which cut rush hour situations and traffic. The roads will be wider and more smooth for the environment.

Moreover, it would be a great idea to limit the use of cars because it will improve safety and business. Most instances when cars weren't used in different regions of the world, it led to the improvement of businesses but also better safety. In Vauban, having less placement for cars created more safety for customers to go into their desired place. It also has been more accessible and compact to public transportation. Limiting less cars progresses the world all around.

In conclusion, it will be a huge advantage to limit the use of cars because it will protect the enviormnent, cut difficulties while on the road, and improve businesses and safety. Using less cars will not only protect ourselves but protect the world that we live in.    ";0
"Dear principle,

I believe that your first policy seems to be a good one. As long as students are not using phones during important class times they should be allowed to have their cell phones. I do not see why they should not be allowed to use their phone during a free period such as lunch or an advisory class.

Although, this is a very good policy their should be an agreement that phones must be in a locker during important classes. Also, since this is such a sweet deal for all students, I feel that if students are using a cell phone during a class that they should not have a phone in, that their are strict coincidences such as:

Detention

Suspension ( in school)

&

Suspension (out of school).

I also feel that for every time they are caught with a phone in the wrong classes, that the punishment gets longer and longer each time. Also, if they do not learn their lesson after 3 times they cannot attend ANY fun school activities.

If they are caught with a phone in the wrong class more than 5 times that they should be suspended for the rest of the year, and when they get back next year that student should not have any phone privileges at all.

If you disagree, I understand but i think you should agree with me one hundred percent. Phone use should be okay as long as it's a strict policy. No phones out of a free period or you face the coincidences. Now, doesn't that sound like a fair deal to you? Because i must say, that seems extremely fair to me and it sounds like an amazing deal as well. Now, I know you adults usually don't make deals with us students, but i think this is a fair exception.";0
"""

the Electoral college have been discovred by our founding fathers in the constitution""

why distroy something that was given to us? over time we have been voting for the Electoral College not the president. I personally think we should be able to vote based on popular vote,

Over years, we voted for the Electoral College it consits of voting for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral votes by congress, sounds diffict right? well this is how they run things, personally I think we should vote based on popular votes because according to source 2 under ""

what's wrong with the electoral college""

many people get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, yikes! not always do we get control whom we vote for , it all depends on the state. We should be equal, Electoral college is unfair to voters. in the same source they state that the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational harsh words? but its true.

Lets take a look at the present. President Obama who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes since were a large state we get more votes. take a look at map where its shows the breakdown of the number of electoral votes, it shows each state. many small state have less than 5 electoral votes simply because its not huge, but yet again you're voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Popular votes have many benfits such as equallty and justice's. In source 3:

""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president""

paragraph 21 popular vote was very close in Florida (2012) .

It have been said that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off a potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states. popular votes have a chance and will be picked based on popular vote. In source 3: states that they is no pressure for run-off elections ,It's provided a clear winner , sounds good doesn't it? One single vote can decide an election sounds stressful. Popular votes are bascially stress free and in the Democrats in Texas ,Republicans in california  their vote have no effect they leave it to the popular vote.

In conclusion, popular votes have such great benfits and had more justice and give better oppourity to those who bascially are in a sticky sitution. Electoral College have so much to do with the voce president and is indirect.         ";0
"There are three key reasons that NASA would not want to hidde the evidence or wouldn't want a ancient civilzation. One reason is that having a ancient civilzation would be a key thing to research. Another one is it would make the popularity and profits go up for NASA. The Third reason is that the face is two miles wide, and resembles a butte, from the camera's quality.

They wouldn't want to hide this civilzation, because they would have reasearch and more popularity. NASA's defenders say they wish there was a civilzation. The article stated this about the Nasa budget: ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an Ancient civilzation on Mars."" They want there to be one but that isn't what it is.

NASA would get more donations and profit if this was true. This means NASA wouldn't want to deny it if it even was true. The reasoning of the conspiracy theorists are wrong saying that they want to hide this evidence, because they don't. This would enable them to accomplish farther space study and more information about an extra terristral civilzation.

The camera they used in 2001 compared to 1977 had a way better camera. Also they stated in the article ""...on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"". This takes out the reasoning of the conspiracy theorists that their were clouds and shadows blocking the camera that made it appear as a butte in 2001 compared to when it looked like a face in 1977.

NASA has done extensive research on this topic and wished it was true. The facts prove it is not real, and how it would help NASA if it was. As the cameras have gotten better and people have resoned better it proves the Mars face was a natural mishap from shadows of the two mile wide butte. ";0

"When considering whether to add one and a half more hours to the school day, several important factors must be taken into account. Firstly, providing an extended school day would take away from time students otherwise would spend on after-school activities, such as club meetings or sports practices. For instance, a student who is on the school's football team would have to decide between sacrificing time spent developing their team skills or risk sacrificing their academic pursuits. 

Secondly, this extra hour and a half would also put a strain on our already stretched teachers and staff. As the school day length increases, so do the workloads for teachers, making it harder for them to focus on their students. Additionally, due to the lack of time for other pursuits such as research, the pay might become too poor to attract new teachers and staff.

Finally, this longer school day would leave students tired and unable to learn as effectively as they would when properly rested. During an extended school day, students would be less alert and less likely to absorb what they are taught, reducing the quality of their education. 

These are just a few of the reasons why the school should not add one and a half more hours to the school day. It is important to take student's health, well-being, and education into account when determining what is best for the school. Therefore, I strongly urge the school against extending the school day.";1
"As an 8th grader, I have always been curious about the impact of committing to a career at a young age. Some people seem to have it all figured out, knowing exactly what they want to do when they grow up, while others are still trying to find their passion. After researching and analyzing the examples of successful people, I have come to the conclusion that committing to a career at a young age can lead to career success.

Firstly, let's take a look at the examples of successful people who committed to their careers early on. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook in his sophomore year of college, and Elon Musk dropped out of college to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams. These individuals demonstrate that with hard work and dedication, committing to a career at a young age can lead to great success.

On the other hand, there are also examples of people who did not commit to a career at a young age and have struggled as a result. For example, Steve Jobs did not start working on Apple until he was in his mid-20s, and he has stated that if he had started earlier, he might have been more successful. This shows that waiting too long to commit to a career can lead to missed opportunities and a lack of progress.

So, how does trust in a career lead to career success? When you commit to a career at a young age, you are more likely to trust in your abilities and have a clear direction in life. This trust can lead to a sense of purpose and motivation, which are crucial for achieving success in any field. Additionally, committing to a career early on allows you to gain valuable experience and build a network of connections, both of which are essential for career advancement.

Personally, I have found that committing to a career at a young age has helped me stay focused and motivated. When I was in 6th grade, I started taking coding classes, and I have continued to pursue this interest throughout middle school. By committing to this career path early on, I have been able to gain experience and build a network of connections in the tech industry.

In conclusion, committing to a career at a young age can lead to career success. Through research and personal experience, I have found that trust";1
"I think the Facial Action Coding System can bring some help into classrooms. Most students, like myself, get bored when working on the computer. If the computer can read our face expression to see that we are bored and change what's on the screen to something more appealing, then maybe it would brighten the mood.

There's no doubt that most students don't like school and fine it incredibly boring. Working on the computers brings a sort of excitement because we prefer technology over standard teachings. Personally, I would prefer to sit on the computer, like I am now, and learn and do assignments. In fact, I'd rather be able to sit at home and work on school work and be able to take breaks whenever I feel like it.

School is like work, I hate it. if this FACS technology can brighten things up at school, then just maybe it wouldn't be so boring. Maybe I wouldn't mind getting up at 6:30 every morning to get ready and go somewhere I don't even want to go. I would love for a computer to read my facial expressions and change what's on the screen to something more suitable for me.

Like I said before, it's no surprise that the majority of students do not like school. This FACS technology could really have a bright future. If it all goes well then it just might make school a place where children and young adults would actually look forward to going to.               ";0
"Why would seeking multiple opinions about advice on something help someone make a better choice? They might see things from other peoples perspective, or get more options when choosing the better choice. In the next few paragraphs, you will find how multiple opinions could be helpful when asking for advice.

Different points of view. Most people have a different perspective about everything. When asking for advice, you will most likely get a different response from each person. Seeking a number of people for advice could help you get a better understanding on how that person sees your ""problem"". It could also help you on making a better decision.

Multiple or different choices. Sometimes it's difficult to make a choice on things, you may be an indecisive person. If, or when you seek multiple people for advice, you get a different response from them. That will give you different options to choose from when choosing what or how to handle it. When you have multiple choices, you could always narrow them down to the choice you think is best. Making it easier to decide.

How to handle or deal with it. It can be frustrating when asking for advice. Sometimes peoples answers may be unhelpful, or might make the thing your asking about worse. Seeking out different people to talk to can help with that. Some of their responses might be helpful, others might not. If most peoples answers are helpful, you could choose the person who gave the most helpful advise, and go with their answer. That might help you deal with or handle the situation.

In conclusion, seeking out multiple opinions on advice can be helpful at times. You might never get good advice out of anyone, leaving you to give yourself advice. In my own opinion, I think it gives you a wide variety when choosing what to do. Which could guide you to making a better decision. ";0
"The creation of the Facial Action Coding System has the potential to be very innovative and useful in today's society. In schools, teachers often have difficulty obtaining the attention of students and maintaining it when they have it. This could be a result of the way they are teaching, and how it makes the students feel. The use of FACS in all classrooms would be found valuable.

Problems such as obtaining attention could easily be solved with the use of the FACS. If students are placed in a classroom, and are unhappy and bored, they are less likely to pay attention and learn at the rate they are capable of. The FACS can record these students' emotions and help change the method of teaching used in that class to interest the students. As stated in the passage by Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This could potentially change the students attitude towards learning for the better.

A teacher is capable of understanding verbal communication better than that which is nonverbal. Unless a student tells their teacher he or she is confused or bored, the teacher has little to no way of knowing this. Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" The FACS is able to detect such forms of emotion, and make corrections based upon them. This process makes the FACS more capable of dealing with these situations than any teacher.

Emotion is displayed often through facial expressions. Certain muscles in your face respond to specific emotions you are feeling at the time. It is not uncommon for a student to put on a fake smille or expression of understanding towards a teacher when he or she is bored and could care less. A teacher may have some difficulty understanding if the student's emotions are real or fake. Luckily the FACS recieves data from the recognition of movement in muscle tissues. The FACS is programmed to recognize which muscles move during each emotion. To provide an example the author explains, ""But in false smiles, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" SInce a different muscle is used in fake smiling than in that which is real, the FACS can tell the difference between the two expressions with ease.

The facts about FACS suggest that it is a perfect candidate for the use of innovative technology in the classroom. This system can improve the learning rates, as well as the mental growth of the students in a classroom. FACS can easily be proven valuable in all classrooms, as well as in many other environments among modern society.

"Dear Mr. Principal,

I hope that you will see that everyone should do community service for at least three hours a week. Everybody could achieve the highest grades in school and go on to complete college. I volunteer three days a week and would be willing to do more.

If we work together in our society we can achieve anything and everything. We could end world hunger, we could end all wars forever. Although we must not forget are past so history doesn't repeat itself. Nobody should have to go through that.

If we show compassion for one another we can dismantle the walls of unfairness and put up the walls of peace and prosperity. Nobody likes to get bullied and it's mostly out of a cruel hatred of what someone did to them. Nobody will accomplish anything if this continues and the world will go into turmoil.

This is a dire time when everybody needs to work together. If we do not work together we shall perish because there is no I in team. If you find it please tell me, but I don't think you will. Nobody should be denied help no matter what the circumstances.

I am just hoping Mr. Principal that you will consider my proposal and make everyone do community service for at least three hours a week. I am sure that if people do this they will feel better about themselves and they will make new friends.

From one hopeful student.                  ";0
"Aliens are real, Frank I'm telling you. The aliens made that face on Mars. Why do you think that, Grayson? No one can step on Mars. If a person steps on Mars, they will die. No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die.

Well I have something to say. Aliens do not exist. If they were real, they would have took over the world. They would have been making us do work every single day. f they came here they would probaly have killed us by now. Have they killed us, have they started making us do work? No, they haven't.

Grayson? Yes, Sir? I heard you and Kevin talking about how aliens made that face on mars. Both of you are wrong. You were right about the no aliens part, but everything else was wrong. We just now figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. It is common enough in Cydonia. When we took the picture, I have got a lot of e-mails saying ""what is that thing?"" I even got a e-mail from Michael Bay saying that he is going to use that image for a movie. This stuff is crazy!

Thats awesome sir! Wait, Grayson there is more. The picture is accually the Martian of a butte or mesa. It's common across the American west. I hope we can find more stuff like that. Me too that was a wierd experience.      ";0
"Cars are an important part of American Culture, but a superpower country using them has big consequences.  Pollution is getting worse and worse, and greenhouse gases are heating up our world. There are a few advantages to limiting car usage: safety is improved, and less pollution.

Paris recently enforced a tentative law that banned driving so as to clear the air of pollution. Warm days and cold nights were trapping the car emissions (Source 2). In the other side of the world, America's car selling stats are decresing. This could mean that cars will be used less and less in the U.S., which would definitely benefit smoggy places like L.A. and New York (Source 4).

Fun fact: automobile accidents are the leading cause of desth for teenage Americans.

Now, if we were to remove that, then there would be no deaths. Thus, safety is improved. Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford motor Company, found that ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time... and improve safety"". (Source 4) Ford and Mercedes are already calling themselves ""mobility"" companies with a wider product range.

The world would be so much happier with less deaths and breathable air, so cars should be limited. Days where driving is not allowed would be a great idea for America, like in Bogota, Columbia. The capital city of Bogota was devoid of traffic jams and violators who used cars faced 25 dolllar fines (Source 3). The goal was to promote smog reduction and safety. America should follow this example and try to set one for other countries, because planet Earth doesn't have much time left and humans need to all they can before they become extinct.    ";0
"Dear Principal,

Many kids all over the country talk on cell phones. We use them to communicate with one another. We also use cell phones for emergencies. For example if are out with your friends and you need to talk with one of your parents what do u do? You call them or text them. All though you can use them for urgent cares, students at school and adults at work can get distracted bye a cell phone.

Policy one states, students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and only use them during lunch and passing period but phones have to be turned off during class time. Policy two states, students are not allowed to have cell phones at all. Policy two is a better choice because have a cell phone can be extremely distracting to students and maybe even teachers. School is a department of education to learn new things and life long skills. Students also might get hurt texting on a phone they will be to busy to pay attention to a flight of stairs two steps away. If you decide policy one you might have complaints about cell phones ringing during the middle of class which does not just alarm the owner but also the rest of the class.

By picking policy two you have eliminated the disruption for students and have made it easer for students to learn as much as possible.";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME:

Over the past few days you have been trying to decide whether or not to require all students to perform community service. Many students have already chosen to do community service such as tutoring elementary school children and cleaning up litter. To set this as a standard is a remarkable idea.

In this world, there is much litter due to all the packaged products, most of which ends up on the streets of our town, taking away of the beauty of it. Having students adopt a highway could really improve it, making our school proud. Also, community service is a great way to improve a student's behavior, and looks great on a college application. Therefore, creating a requirement of it would make everyone from students to teachers happy.

Though some students may feel that community service is a waste of their free time, it really isn't. While they pick up litter, they will be around friends and enjoying themselves, while getting the job done. Or while they tutor a child, they will be enhancing their ability to get along with a child for babysitting job as a teen and will also be preparing for their future as a parent.

As you can see, while community service looks great on a college application, it also sets for well behaved students in the classroom. This is a great way to improving the future of your students.

Thank You,

"Phones & Driving

Should humans be allowed to use their cellar device while driving a truly age old question. People should be able to use their phone only if they have a car mount and are trying to use the GPS in my opinion. Otherwise pull to the side of the road if you just have to send a call or text. I truly don't understand what is that indispensable that you have to risk not only your life but others lives by picking up your phone. Just pull in to your local fast food or store and send that text that will (I assume) complete your life.

You know people have got seriously injured doing it ........

It's crazy the number of people that have died by texting and driving. Just in 2013 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Even more telling The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. (1.6!!)

Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. 74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. These are few stats that support my thesis but the stories hit closer to home for me the story of seven year old Xzavier is particularly disturbing A driver who allegedly was texting behind the wheel hit seven-year-old Xzavier Davis-Bilbo, dragging him nearly 20 feet in the process. The crash paralyzed Xzavier, and he spent four and a half months in the intensive care unit.

He won't ever walk again. That young man was only seven nowhere close to the prime years of his life. Know he can't play sports, run to the bus stop, or even jump up for a high-five because somebody was ""allegedly"" distracted by their phone.

But I can keep control i'm not them If it's one thing I know I know that people always think they can do something until they are proven wrong. Don't be that person this isn't a game this is literally life or death. Just because you haven't hit anyone yet doesn't mean your a celestial being at driving you have just been lucky. Other counter arguments might say but what I just need to do one little thing for work or school. Myself a guilty procrastinator (this is why I am making up this class) understand this argument but just be late for work or school and do it at home. Think about it what's worse killing someone by not paying attention or being late for work/school.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion t's now illegal to hold your phone while driving in the state of Georgia, part of a sweeping hands-free law that went into effect Sunday. Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rules even tapping ""play"" on a Apple playlist while not parked face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second time getting caught. The law, signed by Gov. Nathan Deal in May, aims to curtail driving fatalities in the state. So even if you believe a astounding driver you'll go to jail so just pull over.

"In a competitive world where automobiles keep getting faster, drivers are more reckless, and the death toll is rising, a solution to maintain public safety is necessary. Distracted and careless drivers may no longer be a public menace with the rise of a new technology, driverless cars. Driverless cars are beneficial to the public because the cars will have a better sense of the world around them, and they will eliminate most of the dangers of drunk and/or drowsy drivers.

The continued evolution of a self-driving car has created many advanced sensors that can sense and adjust to the world around it more efficiently than any human.

According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" a sensing system called LIDAR that ""uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" This would eliminate the current problem of blindspots and reduce the rate of collisions dramatically. The LIDAR system would also be able to instantly sense any changes in the surrounding area, where as a human would only be aware of a change if he/she looked in the correct mirror, or when a collision was already happening. There has also been an advance in wheel sensors. According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", these sensors can detect various dangerous situations and can ""...cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" Obviously, these sensors can keep the passengers and general public safer than just one unassisted driver.

Along with more advanced features, comes the elimination of many public menaces and dangerous drivers. If a driver is drowsy, they won't be endangering the public, because the car would be driving for them. There won't be any slip of the wheel to send a car into a ditch, a heavy foot excelerating the car into a tree or pedestrian, or fender benders because the driver was unable to apply the brake. Of course, if the car would happen to need a driver, the safety sensors could easily wake up the sleeping passenger with vibrating seats, as mentioned in paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" voices demanding the driver to take over, and other alarms to wake the driver up. In the case of drunk driving, even though they may need to take the wheel in certain situations, it would be quite rarely, and would still decrease the danger of drunk drivers. Someday the self-driving car may no longer need any human assistance, which would eliminate the danger of drowsy and drunk drivers all together.

In conclusion, the creation of self-driving cars would be beneficial to overall public safety because the developing sensors can already detect and adapt to changes more efficiently than a human can, and it would eliminate the danger of sleeping, distracted, and drunk drivers. ";0
"Summer is the time for students to have fun and enjoy their break to the fullest extent. However, it is also the time when students forget all the knowledge they learned in school. To prevent this from occuring, schools require students to complete summer projects. The students' experiences and knowledge could provide a unique design to their summer projects. Therefore, summer projects that are assigned to assure students continue learning during their break should be student-designed because they will have more freedom to use their creativity and they will have less stress by doing something they want to do.

To start, students are capable of developing something creative when they are given the choice to pick what they want to do. For instance, a student can think of many impressive ideas to base their project on. Forcing a student to work on something they did not choose limits their creativity and decreases their interest in the project. In addition, when a student cannot pick their project, they tend to turn in something horrible. If students are allowed to work on something they feel passionate about, they will put the effort to develop something of good quality. Therefore, students will make an outstanding project if they decide what to do.

Furthermore, students will be less stressful. School work is an unavoidable stressor that causes students to turn in bad work. If teachers design the project, some students will be stressed because they might not know what to do. For example, a foreign exchange student can be assigned a project about American traditions. The student's stress will rise due to not knowing anything other than his countries' traditions. As a result, a student's lack of knowledge about an assigned topic will lead to the stress of knowing they will receive a bad grade. Also, stress can have a negative impact on vunerable students. To illustrate, students who do not handle stress well can stop enjoying their summer and fall into depression or anxiety. There are many students who are scared of humiliation in front of their peers; presenting a bad project will not only increase their stress but it will decrease their self-esteem. In summary, working on a teacher-designed project will increase students' stress levels.

Although a teacher can design a project that will encourage students to learn something new, students will feel more confortable working on something they want to work on. It is for this reason that they should have the liberty of choosing their project. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they can be creative and students will not be stressed.        ";0
"Electoral college... what a compromise! the electoral college should be removed and replaced by the popular vote for the president because our votes don't really count and the electors are not always fair.

In the passage it had said ""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for the president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors."" This means our votes are not really counting. The state electors are the ones who are actually selecting the president for us. Candidates don't spend time in states that they have no chance of winning. Putting the fate of presidency in the hands of a few swing votes is rediculous. The electoral college is irrational and doesn't show much of reality. Some people tend to lose interest in the president's because of the way they feel about their votes. Thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election and vote directly instead for representitives to do so. People have refused to vote for party candidates and wan't to cast a vote for whomever they please. There are over sixty percent of people that would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Another reason why electoral college should get replaced is because it is not fair sometimes. ""can voters control whom their electors vote for? not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? sometimes."" This is the disater factor, it is hardly expected to reflect on the will of the people. A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states do. At times a presidents can have more popular votes and the other less fewer electoral votes and the one with the popular votes lose and that only happened once. In run off elections if people know that their vote will not have an effect and think its unfair than they have less incentive to pay attention to any compaign than they would if the president were picked by popular votes. Potential voters will turn off the electoral method if they know a candidate has not hope of building up their state.

That is why electoral votes should be replaced with popular votes for the president because most of the time our votes do not count and it is unfair to us.    ";0
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is an anachronism. It belongs in the past and should not decide who are president is going to be anymore because its not who the majority of people really want to be leading,it could cause a tie,and its unfair to voters.

Abolishing the electoral college has been a thing people have wanted gone for some time. Because of the electoral college the popular vote has not effected who becomes president. According to the article,(The Indivisible Electoral College),over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tha the one we have now. this means many people would rather switch out the electoral college with a direct vote. With the electoral college still up voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose again.

Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in an election. According to the article,(The Indivisible Electoral College),if the election was a tie it will be thrown to the House of Representatives,where state delegations vote on the president.This mean that people would still have no say in the matter of choosing a president.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnner take system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. According to the article,during the 2000 campaign,seventeen states didnt see canidates at all. This means voters didnt even have a chance to vote.

The electoral college should be ruled out in the future because its not who people really want to lead,it could result in a tie, andits unfair to voters. If its removed then there would be better leaders in the future.    ";0
"Would it be a good idea to use technology such as computers to read students emothinal expressions. Some people would argue that it is not a good idea beacuse what if some students dont want the computer to tell waht ther felling, they would think it was a little weird. I think that it would be a good idea here is why.

I think it would be a good I dead for computers to read students emotional expressions. I think this because say if somebody is falling be hind in class and the computer can tell. The computer could change the chapter or less he or she is confused with so they could understand it better. The student would no longer be confused and could catch up.

Some people would say that what if the computer thinks the kid doesn't under stand the material that he or she is learning. The computer would change the lesson up a little bit so they could understand it better, but in the long run doesn't. In that case the computer would make it harder for that paiticular student to learn the material given to them.

Some stundents would like it because it would help them ina way that makes them understand the lesson or chapter better witch also would help there grade. If I had the chance to use this technology I would.

Sometimes I am a little lost or cunfused and if you dont get that lesson you could fall farther and aferther in the hole. and never catch up. Whith this technology u would nerver fall behind.

With all the infomation we have the technology could ether help out a student or make them fall behind. The information we have concluds that we would still be etter of we the technology. So not so many people are falling behind and getting confused. You would be able to keep up with your class and not get losed. This is what I think about having this technology to read students emotional expressions.              ";0
"Texting while Driving

Many people love their cell phones for calling, texting, listening to music, playing games and more. I believe no one should be on their cell phone or electronic devices while driving for their safety and their peers safety. When texting while driving could cause you to get to focused on your conversation on the phone and causes you to not pay attention on the road and the driver might end up driving off of the road into another lane, hitting another car, and etc when you can just wait until you reach your destination.

Most cars there is no need of touching your phone because there is a build in voice system you could talk to and say the message you want to send out loud instead of texting. Phone stands are good while driving also, it comes in handy while using a gps or even wanting to send a text message because your not physically holding your phone, it's sitting up on a stand in front of you.

When you text and drive it increases the chances of a crash by 23 percent. Over 424,000 people were injured in car crashes from texting and driving.      ";0

"Our social lives now a days practically depend on cars. The truth is, we don't need cars as much as many of us think. There's probably more advantages than disadvantages to not owning or using a car as often. In articles one, two, three, and four it talks about reasons why we should'nt use a car and what happens if we do so often; you tend to have a healthier lifestyle, it helps the environment and ozone, and it reduces stress. So really, limiting car usage helps both you and the environment stay healthy and clean.

People tend to have a healthier life due to limiting their car use. In part of Germany the majority of the residents dont own cars. ""As she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."", Article one. This shows how unlike some parts of the world, Germany has many people outside riding their bikes, walking around and many children playing outside other then being stuck inside at home or in a car. In Article four it states, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."". This is in New York, one of the cities with the most traffic and cars on the streets. New York made a prgram called the ""bike-sharing program"" which has showed great responces and has kids like the ones before mentioned being social and being more active with friends.

Limiting car usage also helps the environment and ozone. In Paris there was a lot of smoge for days and they had to take action. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."", states Article two. After this ban the smog cleared a few days later. This shows how easily car can pollute the air and the environment. In Article four it states, ""Since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."". Cars are one of the main reasons for the environment being polluted and it can be stopped easily if people car-pooled, rode their bikes or walked.

Not only does limiting car usage and using a different alternative keep us active, it also reduces our stress. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Bussinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."", Article three. This was in Colombia where they had a day where no one could use their cars. The people felt relieved to have a day where they could just relax and go outside and get some fresh air. Also in Article one it states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""."" This was also in Germany in a place called Vauban where more than half of the families didn't own cars. This shows how using a bike or walking other than using a car helps you reduce the stress that you have that also includes driving around others that block your way or speed.

In conclusion, limiting car usage tends to help others have a healthier lifestyle, it helps the environment and ozone, and helps others reduce stress. The chairman of the Ford Motor Company in Article four states, ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey."". There's probably more pros than cons in limiting car usage because all it really does is make our lives harder. The long term effect of using cars is more important than the short term which is getting to your destination which you can do any other way and it's healthier and cleanier for everyone.            ";0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that enforcing a curfew for teens in cities has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, a curfew can improve public safety, well-being, and productivity. On the other hand, it can also lead to negative consequences such as increased crime rates, decreased academic performance, and a loss of personal freedom.

One of the main advantages of enforcing a curfew is that it can improve public safety. Teens who are out late at night are more likely to be involved in criminal activities such as vandalism, drug use, and gang violence. By enforcing a curfew, cities can reduce the number of teens on the streets at night, which can lead to a decrease in crime rates. Additionally, a curfew can also help to reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety, as fewer cars will be on the road during peak hours.

Another advantage of a curfew is that it can improve teen well-being. Teens who are out late at night are more likely to be exposed to negative influences such as drugs, alcohol, and violence. By enforcing a curfew, cities can protect teens from these negative influences and promote a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, a curfew can also help to reduce stress and anxiety levels in teens, as they will have more time to rest and recharge.

However, enforcing a curfew can also have negative consequences. One of the main disadvantages is that it can lead to increased crime rates. Teens who are not allowed to be out late at night may be more likely to engage in criminal activities during the day, when they are not under the watchful eye of their parents or guardians. Additionally, a curfew can also lead to a decrease in academic performance, as teens may be more likely to miss school or fall behind on their studies.

Another disadvantage of a curfew is that it can lead to a loss of personal freedom. Teens who are not allowed to be out late at night may feel restricted and frustrated, which can lead to resentment and rebellion. Additionally, a curfew can also lead to a loss of trust between parents and their children, as parents may feel the need to monitor their children's every move.

In conclusion, enforcing a";1
"Everyone has a car for the most part. It's used for a wide verity of things, like going to work, taking your child to school, and after noon sports, and even going out with the family for a little drive because its a nice day outside. People take there cars and use them for anything so they don't have to walk to where they have to be or want to be. There are many good reasons people can say why they need their car for everything, but have you ever looked at the advantages of limiting the usage of your car?

In the United States, the environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities,and legislators are starting to act cautiously. Many experts say that public transport transportion serves will play a much bigger role in a new six-year if the federal transportation bill is approved sometime this year. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent found other ways of transportation. If we where to try to not use our cars for a day or two it would probably be the hardest thing on earth for us to do. we relaye on our cars more then anything, but it would make the place we call home much happier and healthier. Just take Paris for example and look at what they have done to prevent people from using there cars because of what it has been doing to the air. They are actually trying to make a different and show people how much better things could be if we stoped using our cars so much.

Paris begins to ban driving because of all the pollution its causes in the air. On Monday's every car with an even number license plate will be ordered to leave their cars at home or they will suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same will appy to the odd number plates on Tuesday. Almost 4,000 drives where find, and Twenty-seven people had there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Congestion went down 60 percent in the captial of France and after five-days of intensifying the pollution, it later rivaled in Beijing and China, which is known as one of the most polluted cited in the world. The cold nights and the warm days cause a layer of air to trap inside the cars emission. Diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Compared to a 53.3 percent average of Diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe side.

Paris typically has more pollution then all the other Eurpean capitals. Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Delivery companies complained of the lost of revenue, while eceptions were made for plug-in cars, like the hybrids. The Hybrids are much better to use and they hold 2-3 more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Fridays all the way to Mondays, according to the BBC. The pollution cleared up on Monday for the ruling of the French party to rescind the ban for the odd number plates of Tuesday.

In conclusion, limiting our car usage really isn't that bad. Its actually helping our plant alot. All the smoke and gas is just polluting our air that we need to breath and with all the pollution in the air your just going to breath in a big cloud of gas or smoke. Its just like smoking, you don't want to breath in the smoke that comes from a car into your lungs because its bad and can hurt you just like cigerets can. We can stop this from happening if we give our cars a break or switch to a different kind of car, but really we should just limit the usage of the cars we have now. We can go outside and walk to where we need to be and just fresh air that isn't being polluted and we can exersize, which a lot of people need, so limeting the usage of cars would help not only the air, but the amount of fat people in the world as well. Limiting car usage is going to make a huge change in helping our plant and it would make the earth a better, happier, and healthier place to live.    ";0
"In today's education system, praising students when their work is not up to its full potential has become a common practice. While it may seem like a positive way to motivate students, there are both positive and negative effects to consider.

On the positive side, praising students can boost their confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment. When students receive praise for their work, they feel valued and appreciated. This can lead to increased motivation and a desire to continue working hard. Additionally, praising students can create a positive learning environment, where students feel comfortable taking risks and making mistakes.

However, there are also negative effects to consider. Praising students for work that is not up to its full potential can create unrealistic expectations and lead to a false sense of accomplishment. When students receive praise for work that is not up to par, they may become complacent and not strive to improve. Additionally, praising students for work that is not up to its full potential can create a disconnect between the student's work and the expectations of their teacher or parents.

Furthermore, praising students can also lead to a lack of constructive criticism. When students receive only praise for their work, they may not receive the feedback they need to improve. Constructive criticism is essential for growth and development, and without it, students may not be able to identify areas where they need to improve.

In conclusion, praising students when their work is not up to its full potential can have both positive and negative effects. While it can boost confidence and create a positive learning environment, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations, a false sense of accomplishment, and a lack of constructive criticism. As educators and parents, it is important to find a balance between praising and providing constructive criticism to help students reach their full potential.";1
"Bonjour! 

For my essay, I will be researching the tourist attractions in France, the types of cuisine you can expect to find, and what to expect in terms of weather and people. 

First off, let's talk about the tourist attractions in France.  There are so many amazing places to visit in France!  From the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris to the beautiful beaches of the French Riviera, there's something for everyone.  Did you know that the Louvre Museum in Paris is home to the Mona Lisa?  It's true! And the Notre-Dame Cathedral is just as impressive. 

Next up, let's talk about the food in France.  Oh, the food!  France is known for its exquisite cuisine, which includes escargots, ratatouille, and croissants.  And have you heard of macarons?  They're these delicious little meringue-based cookies that are to die for!  But honestly, the food in France is just... wow. 

Now, let's talk about the weather in France.  Well, it's... um...  France has a temperate climate, which means it can be quite chilly in the winter and warm in the summer.  But hey, at least it's not as hot as... um...  Some places.  And did you know that France is home to some of the most beautiful countryside in Europe?  The rolling hills and vineyards are just... 

Finally, let's talk about the people of France.  The French are known for their... um...  hospitality?  They're so friendly and welcoming";1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students should be required to perform community service. Community service makes people a better person in their community. It also shows that we care for the world around us. For example students who are more active in their community are more likely to succeed and change the world. Some actions that students make are good choices and others are bad choices, Community service is a good way to change the environment around us.

Some times in life students don't do things because of their friends and other times they do things because of their friends. Well if a popular student could convince another student to perform community service then that student could convince someone else to perform community service. Spreading the news about community service to everyone around us will forever change the world and how we think about it.

Performing community service is not a right but a privilege. Students should be required to perform community service if their grades are low. Not only if their grades are low, but to show go deeds towards people in the neighborhood, communities, city, and even their state.

Some community service participants have even been awarded because of their good deeds that they chose to do.

Community service should be required for all students no matter how old or young they are. As long as they can make a difference in life then they should be required to perform community service. Community service is not just picking up trash around parks or helping out at nursing homes, but a way of life. Community service tasks vary from person to person. Some people might like to help read to little children or help take care of people with disabilities. Community service shows that you have respect for yourself, the people around you, and show much more.

Sincerely,

"Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, believed that hard work was essential to achieving success in life. He believed that success was not simply a matter of luck or intelligence, but rather a result of diligence and perseverance.

One example of the importance of hard work in achieving success is the story of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was born into poverty and faced numerous challenges throughout his life, including depression and financial difficulties. However, he was determined to succeed and worked tirelessly to improve himself and his situation. He studied law, read widely, and worked as a lawyer and politician before becoming the President of the United States. Lincoln's hard work and dedication to his goals ultimately led to his success and his legacy as one of the greatest leaders in American history.

Another example of the importance of hard work is the story of Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey was born into poverty and faced numerous challenges throughout her life, including abuse and discrimination. However, she was determined to succeed and worked tirelessly to improve herself and her situation. She studied broadcasting and worked her way up from a local news anchor to a national talk show host. Winfrey's hard work and dedication to her goals ultimately led to her success and her legacy as one of the most influential and successful women in the world.

Hard work is essential to achieving success because it demonstrates a level of commitment and determination. It shows that a person is willing to put in the time and effort necessary to achieve their goals, regardless of the obstacles they may face. Hard work also helps to build character and resilience. When faced with challenges, individuals who are willing to work hard are better able to overcome them and emerge stronger and more determined.

The difference between hard work and intelligence when it comes to achieving success is often overstated. While intelligence can certainly be an advantage, it is not the only factor that determines success. Hard work and dedication are just as important, if not more so. For example, many successful individuals have been able to achieve their goals through sheer determination and hard work, even if they did not have exceptional intelligence.

Hard work plays a crucial role in obtaining safety and security in life. When individuals are willing to work hard, they are better able to provide for themselves and their families. They are also more likely to have a sense of purpose and direction, which can help to";1
"Graduating from high school early is a topic that has been widely debated among students, parents, and educators. While some see the benefits of graduating early, others argue that it may not be the best decision for everyone. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of graduating from high school early and analyze the impact this choice can have on one's future.

One of the main benefits of graduating from high school early is that it allows students to start their careers or further their education sooner. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are interested in pursuing a specific field of study or starting their own business. Additionally, graduating early can help students save money on tuition and other expenses associated with college or vocational school.

However, there are also some drawbacks to graduating from high school early. For example, some students may feel rushed or unprepared for the next step in their education or career. Additionally, early graduates may struggle to find employment or may need to take additional courses or training to meet the requirements for their desired field.

Real-world experience can provide valuable insights into the impact of graduating early. For example, a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that early graduates were more likely to enroll in college and earn degrees than those who graduated on time. However, the study also found that early graduates were more likely to drop out of college or earn lower grades than their peers who graduated on time.

To ensure success for those who choose to graduate early, it is important to carefully consider the next step in their education or career. This may involve taking additional courses or training to meet the requirements for their desired field, or pursuing further education or apprenticeships. Additionally, early graduates should seek out mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals in their field to help them navigate the challenges of starting their careers.

In conclusion, graduating from high school early can have both benefits and drawbacks. While it can allow students to start their careers or further their education sooner, it can also lead to feelings of rushed or unpreparedness. To ensure success for those who choose to graduate early, it is important to carefully consider the next step in their education or career and seek out mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals in their field.";1
"Getting to school everyday may not be possible to many students based on their circumstances. To others, their mental health might put them in a position where they are not able to reach their full potential at school, causing their grades to suffer. Whatever the reason may be, taking classes online is a convenient way of being present in school while also meeting the needs of those who need it. Schools offering online classes to students would be a grand benefit to all students, and could make a profound impact on their learning and their grades.

Mental health is a big issue in many teens and often gets in the way of learning; however, distance learning could be a solution to this problem. For example, some students have social anxiety, so going to a crowded school is hard for them. This mental disorder could and often will impact their learning, not allowing students to reach their full potential. If being in a school with a large number of students is upsetting to them, they could take their classes from home. This would allow them to still be able to pursue an education while not being in a triggering environment, which could make a large impact on their grades. In the comfort of their homes, students would be able to move at their own pace to make sure they know the material, stimulating academic success.

Some students may have different circumstances in which they are not able to go to school everyday, but distance learning could help them get the education they need despite these circumstances. For instance, what if a student has to stay home to take care of their sick mother. Because the student needs to stay at home, online classes would be a grand benefit to them. Online classes would allow the student to be able to check up on his mother while still getting an education. With these classes, the student wouldn't have to sacrifice school for his mother, or vice versa: he would be able to do school and care for his mother at the same time.

Sickness often leads students with two options: go to school and run the risk of infecting others, or staying at home while everyone else is learning, ultimately causing them to be left behind in school. Many students wake up sick but still choose to go to school because they are afraid of being left behind and have their grades suffer, especially in more advanced classes. Going to school puts the other students that they come into contact with at a risk of getting sick, and is the main reason how sickness spreads in schools. With the availability of distance learning, however, students who are sick would be more likely to stay at home instead of going to school and contaminating others. They could rest at home and wait out the sickness while not being stressed out about missing school and having to make up work for all of their classes. Online classes are a huge benefit that provides students who are sick with an opportunity to keep up with their school work while not putting others at risk.

In total, distance learning and online classes provides a chance for students to be able to attend school despite their different circumstances. Students would not have to stress out about missing school because they would be able to attend class from home, which would make a positive impact on their grades. Other students wouldn't have to make a choice to pursue an education or care for their sick relative. Some students wouldn't have to choose between their mental health and the opportunity to go to school. They wouldn't have to run the risk of getting other students sick and missing valuable school time. Instead, they would be able to do classwork from home which would make it significantly easier for these individuals to go to school without sacrificing anything. Online classes would allow all students to have an equal opportunity to have an education, regardless of circumstances that would hold them back should distance learning not be available to them. ";0
"Now a days cars and other veicles are the cause of many situations that many places in the world have to deal with. Indeed they do get us to our destination faster, but at what cost? We drive faster so that the earth can die slowly. Cars and veicles are to be blamned for earths killer

POLUTION.

There are some up and downs to faster transportation for example, time  management we get tomplaces in one-third of the time we would if we would go walking to our destination. We wouldn't be freezing when it's called and sweating when it's hot. The down information is that the government waste a lot of money on gas, and car prices, even on fast food resturants. The truth is we dont even need cars, we WANT cars we don't NEED cars, theres a difference of the words and there meanings. For example in the story In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, studies show that 70% of Vauban's families do not own any type of veicles, and 57% sold their veicle just to move there. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two.

Polution...... It kills the earth and infact us aswell very slowly. Each year the government has to waste thousands of dollars to keep producing greenhouses because the use of any type of veicle is monumentous. If we keep doing what we doing there won't be an earth to live on at all. Cars aren't the only thing to blame for polution, we also have to blmame HUMANS, they know using a veicle too much consists on the consumption of gas which creates polution, but they still go out and drive for hours and hours just wasting there whole intire tank of gas. For example 50% of all cars inEurope (which is half of all people with any type of car) produce fuems, (polution) that require our government to develope greenhouses, which waste money aswell.

If we spend all day driving, we let out into the atmosphere some toxic fuems that kills the earth and us aswell. Then making the government waste money to make greenhouses to try to at least advance humans lives for a couple more hundreds of years. Up to 50% of car-intensive ares in America, are to blame for the development of greenhouses, stated in the article called In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars.            ";0
"The UNRRA progam is a great progam for people who want to help around the world. Also, if you are into going on trips o different places this is great for you. They travel all around the world helping and they also get to see knew things!

You should come join because you can help around the world! Many people love to help and around the world and you should try it. On the first time my friend Don and I went on the trip it was great how we could help people after the war. Like how we brought a cago of 335 horses along with enough hay and outs to feed them. We wanted always make sur ethat we cleaned all the mess the war's had left behind.

You should also come to he program because you have the benifet of visiting all inds of places like Greece, China, Europe, and more. By the time I was discharged in in 1947, I been on nine trips. That is more than any other Seagoing Cowboy. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece and it was ver special. Also, in Crete I toured and excavated a castle. Then at the Panama Canal I marvled.

Going on the Atantic Ocean was awesome too! I went on it about 16 times in my years of being a Seagoing Cowboy. It took about two wees to cross it from the astern coast of the United States. To get to China it took a month to get there. Caring fro the animals kept me busy as we crossed the seas. They had to be fed two or three times a day. The time I almost wnet overboard was very scary, but I loved doing what I did.

it was very awesome helping around the world, going to all of the those amazin places, and traveling the Atlanic many times. I may have gottenhurt and times were rough, but I wouldn't chane being a Seagoing Cowboy for anthing. I was onne amazin adventure I will never forget.      ";0
"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, so bear with me on this essay! 😅

So, you know how some people say that teens should have a curfew? Like, they think it's a good idea for us to be home by a certain time? Well, I did some research on that and here's what I found out! 🤔

First of all, having a curfew can really help with crime rates. Like, think about it. If all teens are home by a certain time, there's less chance of them getting into trouble or getting involved in illegal stuff. It's like, if you're not out there roaming the streets at midnight, you're less likely to get into trouble! 🕰️ Plus, it's safer for us too. I mean, think about it. If you're out late at night, you might get mugged or something, and that's not cool! 😨

Another thing that's cool about having a curfew is that it can help with safety in cities. Like, if all teens are home by a certain time, there's less traffic on the roads, and that means it's safer for everyone! Plus, it's easier for parents to keep an eye on us and make sure we're not getting into any trouble. 🚗👀

And finally, having a curfew can help with other outcomes too. Like, it can help us develop a sense of responsibility and discipline. If we know we have to be home by a certain time, we're more likely to stay on track and do our homework and chores and all that good stuff! 📚🧹 Plus, it can help us learn how to manage our time better, which is super important for when we get older and have to manage our own schedules. 🕒

So, yeah! I think having a curfew for teens is a pretty good idea. It can help with crime rates, safety in cities, and other outcomes too! 😃👍 What do you think? Do you think we should have a curfew? Let me";1
"Making a positive first impression is immensely important when meeting someone for the first time. It can have a powerful effect on the success or failure of any relationship, be it with a colleague, friend, or romantic partner. A positive first impression can lead to trust, successful collaborations, and meaningful connections, while a negative first impression can quickly ruin an opportunity or sour a relationship.

Take job opportunities, for example. A potential employer base much of their decisions on an applicant’s first impression. Studies have shown that applicants who are well groomed, confident with their communication, and present themselves with respect and enthusiasm are much more likely to be hired. The same principle applies when looking for new friends or romantic partners. People tend to be attracted to confidence and enjoy talking to someone who communicates clearly.

When it comes to establishing good relationships with peers, a positive first impression goes a long way. People who are kind, calm, and welcoming are more likely to be liked and respected. It's almost a guarantee that an individual who exudes confidence and respect will make a better impression than someone who exudes anger and distrust.

In conclusion, it is incredibly important to strive for a positive first impression when meeting someone for the first time. Making a strong first impression can be the difference between getting an opportunity or losing out to a competitor, building strong relationships or souring them instantly, and being liked by peers or respected by them.";1
"""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is an artical about how Venus is a close neighbor yet incredibly hard to study up close. The author suggest that is is worth the risk needed to study Venus and he had some compeling arguments. after reading this ask yourself would you take the risk?

Venus is a very extrem environment, with temetures that can melt tin. it is so extream that no space craft had survied more than a few hours on the surface of Venus. The planet had an atmospher of mostly carbon deoxide and is rittles with cloudes of sulfur. Despite all of that the author still belivews we should continue to explore Venus.

on of the authors key pointts was ""...once have been the most earth-like planet inour solar system."" The auter went on to say ""Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth.""

I belive this is a great reason to explore Venus more deeply, because if it has any truth to it why is the planet so deadly now? we should lookinto its past and make an understanding of what happend to Venus so we know what could happen to us and possibly even try and prevent it.

The author concluded thier artical by saying ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also,because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" i belive this is the authors main point, not just that we should know more about the planet but that it keeps us sharp and provieds problems to slove. The human mind is curious and will alway want to ""know how it works"" or ""whys it do that"" and if we dont presue those questions then we are learning nothing.

So in conclusion althoghVenus is an extream environment we should explore it more deeply. We should try to find ways to do so. the author gave many points but his best one was simply that the peopel are curious and want to know so show us.      ";0
"Dear State Senator, I send you this letter to bring up an issue that is often debated amongst us Americans. Should we kee the Electoral College? No! The electoral college just doesn't work anymore and we have seen that in the past. You probably ask yourself what is wrong with the Electoral College? The problem with the Electoral College is that it is unfair, it doesn't rely on what the people say and it can sometimes really make the public mad.

The Electoral College is really unfair, especially for voters. We vote for who WE want, not for some other guy to say what we want. Voters want THEIR voice to be heard when they vote not someone else's. When we vote for a presidential candidate we want to vote directly for who we are voting, we want to pick who we want directly. In source 2 the article explains how the Electoral College works. The author says ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What this means is that when you voted for Obama you didn't vote for Obama , you voted for a group of people to vote for who they wanted. So your voice was not heard. Don't you find that unfair to the voters and to the candidates?

Everytime one person votes for a certain presidential candidate, they are basically ignored. The President should be chosen by the people! And at the moment the President is being chosen by politicians who will ""represent"" us and repeat what we say although that has been proven to not always be true. Passage 2 reminds us of the incidence in the 2000 election in which Al Gore lost the presidency to George W. Bush by electoral votes, even though he had more inividual votes. This proves that our state representatives will not always represent us how we want them to, but how they want to represent us. This is the reason why voters need a direct voice from them to picking their leaders. We should pick what we want not what some politicians want. You are probably saying that these incedents do not happen very often, as said in source 3. The article says ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000...but that was the first time since 1888"" This says that situations like this are very rare, yet it is still possible. Even so, wouldn't you rather the people be heard rather than a politician that claims to represent his state?

So many people got mad in 2000 when they just chose the president most people didn't want. There's many ways to make us Americans mad and this is just another one of those ways. In the United States you are supposed to be able to choose what you believe to be right. If you want to choose what you think should be the future's right president then you should be able to pick him and not have to expect anyone's approval or opinion on your vote. You should be able to walk out from the voting center and say

I voted for this guy. Eventually keeping the Electoral College will only cause more problems, because as time goes on the human develops its opinion futher and creates and spreads new ideas meaning that there will be more people picking different things. If you think that what you are picking should be picked you should be able to say ""I want that"" and not have to through the bother knowing that a politician may have chosen what you DON'T want. If you want to make Americans mad, then keep the Electoral College.

In conclusion I think that the Electoral College be removed and the use of popular vote be put into effect because the Electoral College is unfair, it does not reply on what the public says and it makes the Americans mad. Please take this letter into consideration.    ";0
"Winston Churchill was a British politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II. Churchill's life was marked by many challenges and setbacks, but he was able to overcome them and achieve great success. In this essay, I will analyze Churchill's quote ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" and describe a personal experience where I had to overcome obstacles to reach success. Additionally, I will discuss different strategies to be successful, including working hard, keeping a positive attitude, solving problems, trying your best, and learning something new.

Churchill's quote highlights the importance of perseverance and resilience in achieving success. It suggests that success is not just about achieving a specific goal, but also about maintaining a positive attitude and enthusiasm even in the face of failure. Churchill's own life is a perfect example of this. He faced many challenges throughout his career, including losing his first election and being defeated in several others. However, he never lost his enthusiasm and continued to work hard towards his goals.

One personal experience where I had to overcome obstacles to reach success was when I was trying to improve my grades in a particularly challenging class. I struggled to understand the material and often found myself falling behind. However, instead of giving up, I sought help from my teacher and classmates. I also made a conscious effort to study regularly and practice the material outside of class. Despite the initial challenges, I was able to improve my grades and achieve success in the class.

To be successful, it is important to have a combination of different strategies. One of the most important is working hard. Success rarely comes easy, and it takes dedication and effort to achieve your goals. This means setting aside time to study, practice, and work towards your goals. Additionally, it is important to have a positive attitude. A positive attitude can help you overcome obstacles and stay motivated even in the face of failure. This means focusing on the positive aspects of a situation and looking for ways to improve.

Solving problems is also an important strategy for success. In any field, there will be challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome. To be successful, you need to be able to identify these problems and come up with solutions. This means thinking creatively and outside the box to find new ways to approach a problem.

Finally, it";1
"In today's world, many people have gone against the odds and achieved success. These individuals have shown that with hard work, determination, and perseverance, anything is possible. However, failure is also a common experience in life. It is important to understand the causes of failure and how it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to strive for success.

One of the main causes of failure is a lack of motivation. Without a clear goal or reason to work towards, individuals may lose interest and give up. In order to avoid this, it is important to set high goals and have a strong desire to achieve them. This will help keep individuals motivated and focused on their end goal.

Another cause of failure is a lack of planning or preparation. Without a solid plan or strategy in place, individuals may not be able to effectively reach their goals. In order to avoid this, it is important to do research, create a plan, and take action. This will help individuals stay on track and make progress towards their goals.

In addition to these causes, failure can also be a learning experience. By learning from our mistakes, we can gain valuable insights and knowledge that can help us improve and grow. It is important to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as a setback.

Ultimately, aiming high and working to achieve one's goals is the best course of action in order to maximize success. By setting high goals and working hard to achieve them, individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve great things. It may not always be easy, but the rewards are worth it.

In conclusion, there are many examples of people who have gone against the odds and achieved success. Failure is a common experience in life, but it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to strive for success. It is important to set high goals, have a strong desire to achieve them, and do research and planning to effectively reach them. By aiming high, individuals can maximize their success and achieve great things.";1
"When it comes to seeking advice or opinions, it is always beneficial to consult more than one person. Consulting multiple sources of knowledge and experience can provide different perspectives and better inform the decision-making process. Additionally, relying on a more diverse base of sources can help to mitigate the risk of bias and reduce the possibility of making a bad decision. On the other hand, if advice is only being sought from a single source, they may lack the breadth of knowledge needed. Furthermore, the advice from one single person also contains the potential of being biased, as they may have their own personal agenda and motivations.

Recently, I was considering starting my own business and needed some advice. I decided to ask family members, friends, and colleagues who had been successful entrepreneurs and gathered their advice based on their experiences. After taking the time to listen to everyone’s opinion, I was able to make a more informed and well-rounded decision on which path to pursue.";1
"A future with driverless cars can have many mixed feelings. Driverless cars could help solve many issues, but in the same way cause just as many problems. Many companies have been working on driverless cars now for years, but none have a definate answer to a car without any help and opperational needs by humans. Not having a fully driverless car already can represent the struggle, and challenge of creating a driverless car in this era. So i believe that the creation of a driverless car is a waste. They can be dangerous on the streets, cost lots of money, and have no real need in this day and age.

Driverless cars have already been proven to be dangerous on the streets. Companies have not yet come up with the technology for a car that can self-drive; the self-driving cars need a person on the wheel for emegergencies. Also, these cars can brake, steer and move on there own but need the assistance of a human when challenges come in the way. They need special help, and require the driver who is already at the wheel to take over and navigate through work zones and accidents. Having a ""driverless car"" but with a driver in the driver's seat, with his hands already on the wheel, but not driving makes it reduntant. Why waste that effort if a driver is already in the current position to drive.

If companies are putting all this effort into driverless cars, why cant they put the same effort and money into a real world issue? A nice, new car can cost a whole lot of money, and at a low can run upto 25,000 dollars. So a nice, new car that would drive itslef would run upto even much more money than that. We already have nice cars that we can drive oursleves around in, and with no problem at all. We shouldnt be focused on making cars that would make us Americans even lazier by not having to drive them. Companies should instead put this money to helping find the cure for cancer, or fighting against poverty and homelessness in America or other countires. Better things could be done with this money, instead of trying to make Americans even lazier.

A car that can drive itself has no real need in todays age, people drive themsleves fine everyday around the world without a problem. Some might say that having a driverless car is beneficial by having the car drive you somewhere, but then go back home for another family member to use. That isnt a real need, because almost everyone has a car nowadays anyway. Also, you need to have your hands on the sterring wheel while the car drives so its really not an option. What if the car didnt need your hands on the wheel while driving? Well say something harzardous did happen on its way home or a car crash, and the car needed to alert the driver to take over. The driver wouldnt be present, and the car would shut down and not make it to its destination.

Driverless cars are meant to sound fun, while having fun riding in one. Instead, they can infact be a waste of time, all in determination to find a new product for consumers to buy. They can even be a burden to opperate in; adults and young adults learn how to opperate and safely drive a car, but they would need a new curriculum to teach how to opperate a driverless car. They would need to show what to do during your ride in a driverless car versus what not to do. There is even the possiblilty of needing a different license, and test to be able to opperate a driverless car. So why go through all this hassel, and complexity for somwthing new, when we already have a fully functional car now that fullfils our needs.";0
"Distance learning is valuable because not every student is capable of being in a school setting for a number of reasons. Distance learning is online schooling, homeschooling or paid programs like K-12. Online school is exactly like regular school, there's a specific time you need to be online with your instructors, same thing with programs like K-12, you have a specific time to get all things in just like you would in public or private schools. There's many reasons students need to be enrolled in these types of programs, like severe social anxiety, learning disabilities, or health issues. A plethora students across the world face different stipulations than others, like being born with a learning disability.

Many parents strive to enroll their children with learning disabilities into a public school so they wouldn't feel like they don't belong or they're not normal. But some parents take a step back and realize that bullying is a huge issue in public schools, and they don't want them to be exposed to hate or even the unnecessary pressures from learning, that the student wouldn't face if they learned from home. The social and educational stress that is put upon students in public schools is another reason why online schooling would be a good option for students that have severe social anxiety. I have been in a class with a student that was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder, and every time that I would see her, which wasn't often, she would be nauseous or very confused and eager to leave quickly, which led me to believe students with anxiety disorders should be working from home where they are the most comfortable. Seeing someone struggle with being around just a small class of 22 people, made me feel as though online schooling is something certain students really depend on.

Homeschooling by a in home instructor, like a parent or guardian, is another option taken by a number of parents for various reasons. Homeschooling is a great option for parents that don't want students to be exposed of the things that they may have went through when they were a child or the ones that don't want their children's lives to revolve around just school from ages 6 to 18, so they can learn various different skills and show their more creative side. Celebrities like Billie Eilish or Finneas O'Connell, can attest to the fact that homeschooling was something that they feel as though was one of the best things their parents could've done for them. They were able to grow up with the freedom of expression for their creativity and hobbies without the pressures of school being the #1 priority in their lives. Some students never really get to emit or expand upon their talents because school is told to be one of the most important aspects of your lives, and if you don't do well, you'll never succeed in life.

Distance learning is like a god send to the students that crack under the pressure of school and the high expectations that come with it like your social status. With growing up comes the many mistakes you make while growing. Trusting the wrong people, being surrounded with the wrong crowd or just putting yourself in compromising positions are all things that can lead to someone never wanting to go back to a public school. I've witnessed a number of girls in my class get their nude photos exposed to the school because they trusted the wrong person with their body. That kind of backlash and bullying made them enroll into online courses until they felt comfortable with easing back into a public setting. Being able to enroll into online school during such a low point in their lives, could've saved them from wanting to commit suicide or harm themselves if they had to stay and deal with the bullying they faced.

County's that offer distance learning are doing thousands of kids justice by letting them learn at their own pace comfortably. Distance learning could save so many lives and help many others. I truly believe that letting a child progress at their own pace instead of expecting them to be able to run the same race the same way and finish at the same time as hundreds of other students, is an amazing thing. Letting a child be comfortable and able to take care of their health and mental health while being educated is something that should be an open option for those who really need it. Being educated is a key part in what path you will walk through in life, and distance learning is that first step into that path a student will walk through. ";0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to the attention of the student body that you are considering two possible plans of action to deal with the evident cell phone problem. I will go ahead and start by telling you that taking away cell phones all together will only cause misery and sorrow for all. It is my suggestion and that of the school that you would allow us to have our phones available for use in our free time and lunch periods. Of course they would be turned off in class as they should. There are so many reasons that we use phones as much as we do and taking them away will cause a tension like no other. The good outweighs the bad in this situation for many reasons and I am prepared to prove that.

The bottom line and one of the main reasons we should have our phones available for use is the connection. Kids need to be connected and be able to interact with each other. It is simply part of being a growing person. We need that constant interaction to settle our nerves and keep us up on our friends lives. Obviously the class room is not the appropriate place or time for that. However, kids texting and talking in their own free time is completely acceptable. Connection is important to kids. Take it away and all is lost for us all.

There is a big question that goes through a teens mind every time they are told to put there phone away. That question is what is 'What's the point of having a phone if I can't use it?' While it may seem immature and childish it is a legitimate question. Is there really a point of having a phone if you are constantly told to put it up and keep it off. Do you think that a kid or teen texting in the hall is going to bring the world to a stop. Ask yourself for you may have a cell phone to 'what's the point?'

As the day goes by and the homework piles up stress is immense to say the least. One of the great things about cell phones is that they are great at relieving stress. At some points of the day it seems like your world is going to explode. A funny text from a friend is a sure fire way to cheer up your day. Stress cushions and massages can claim to calm you down but the best way to cool your nerves and get a grip is by sitting down and talking to a friend over the phone. Take some of the

It may be one of the worst mistakes made by adults, thinking that taking away cell phones will solve all of their problems. It will only make kids made ,who will in turn make adults and teachers alike, miserable. If you haven't found out already, cell phones are actually for the benefit of all, even in a school environment. It will make life for teachers a breeze and likewise for kids. For all of these reasons and so many more I would ask you with the sincerity of my heart that you will please consider letting us use our cell phones in school.

sincerely,

"If we have access to the greatest technological innovations of human history, shouldn't we be using them to allow students to choose the way they want to learn? Schools have started to incorporate modern technology into the classroom, where schools are surrounded with screens instead of chalkboards and laptops instead of binders. Thus, as technology becomes easier to integrate with learning, many schools have started to give the option of learning through online software rather than sitting in a classroom. I believe that students would be able to benefit from learning through online or video conferencing, because they would be able to learn in a method that is more convenient, less stressful for students with social issues, and more helpful through the use of learning with online media.

Rather than having to sit in a classroom, online learning would allow students to learn in a way that makes them feel the most comfortable, increasing the convenience and ease of learning. The goal of school is to empower students to learn and gain knowledge that will ultimately help them later in life. Therefore, schools should assess what methods allow students to gain the most amount of knowledge in a given amount of time, thus increasing the efficiency of learning. Schools have tried various methods of increasing efficiency, such as making high school start at a later time or making the cafeteria food more healthy. However, these past changes fail in that they do not tailor the school experience based on one's need. Furthermore, if a student learns best at night time, they do not have the option to take their high school schedule at night. Or, if a student learns best on a couch instead a desk, they have to settle with sitting in a desk for most of their day. These examples show that the best way of increase learning efficiency is by giving choice to the students, and online learning gives much more choice compared to traditional school. Students are not tied to sitting in a classroom or learning at specific points in a day, allowing them to choose the way they learn the best. Thus, convenience and choice from distance learning allow students to gain more knowledge and be more successful later in their jobs. Some may argue that the convenience would lead to a lack of physical interactions at a school, isolating students from developing relationships with their peers. However, since distance learning gives students more choice, they can choose how and when they interact with their peers, allowing social relationships to be built on their own time rather than during school time.

Online learning would decrease stress for students who have social issues attending school. For example, some students with mental disabilities have issues being surrounded with hundreds of other students at school. Luckily, online learning can allow these students to receive their education without having to be around others, which makes learning a much easier process. In addition, I have noticed how social media has made many students develop anxiety over social interactions at schools. However, online learning can allow these students to be less focused on social dilemmas at the hallway and more focused on their studying during school time. Therefore, distance learning can be useful to combat the social problems that distract many students from learning at school.

Finally, online learning can make the learning process more engaging and useful to students through the use of online software. For example, I have taken a course online through a program called Virtual Loudoun, and I noticed how the curriculum involved the use of online slide show presentations, videos, and diagrams. This made my learning process much easier, since the various methods of learning kept me more and engaged and interested to learn. Although some classrooms have implemented presentations and videos, most still largely revolve around teachers lecturing to the class, which does not engage students nearly as well as other online methods. Some may argue that online learning does not allow for students to get specialized or individual help if they have issues. However, online learning still retains all of the traditional benefits that come from learning in a classroom. For example, if a students needs specialized assistance, they can easily setup a video conference to talk individually with their teacher. Also, online software can allow students to take quizzes, tests, and assignments at certain deadlines, and teachers can easily grade their work and upload their results to a grade book. Therefore, online learning has all the advantages of normal classroom learning, on top of increased engagement through the use of different learning methods.

Overall, distance learning with the use of technology is the future of learning as it allows students to choose where and when they learn, have less anxiety for those with social issues, receive a better education through the use of online media. All of these example will allow empower students to be more successful once they eventually enter the workforce. Traditional classrooms have been around for hundreds of years, and it's time that society evolves and transforms the way that students learn by using technological innovations.";0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have experienced the impact of effort on learning in two different ways: learning a language and playing video games. While both require a significant amount of effort, the results are vastly different.

Learning a language requires consistent effort and dedication. It involves memorizing vocabulary, grammar rules, and sentence structures. It also requires practicing speaking, listening, and writing in the language. My experience learning Spanish is a prime example of this. I spent hours studying the language, taking classes, and practicing my speaking skills. The more effort I put into learning, the better I became. I was able to understand and communicate in Spanish fluently after several months of consistent effort.

On the other hand, video gaming requires a different kind of effort. While it requires strategy and skill, it also requires a significant amount of time and practice. My experience with playing Fortnite is a prime example of this. I spent hours each day practicing my aim, building skills, and learning new strategies. The more effort I put into gaming, the better I became. I was able to compete at a professional level after several months of consistent effort.

While both learning a language and playing video games require effort, the results are vastly different. Learning a language requires consistent effort and dedication, while video gaming requires a significant amount of time and practice. In my experience, the effort I put into learning Spanish paid off with fluency, while the effort I put into playing Fortnite paid off with competitive skills.

In conclusion, effort plays a crucial role in learning, but the kind of effort required and the results obtained vary depending on the task. While both learning a language and playing video games require effort, the results are vastly different. Learning a language requires consistent effort and dedication, while video gaming requires a significant amount of time and practice. It is important to understand the kind of effort required for a specific task and the results that can be obtained through that effort.";1
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME,

I have been informed that there is a school issue regarding whether students should be required to perform community service. Students should be required to perform community service. I think it would really say something about our school and SCHOOL_NAME would take a leader role in the community. The students should be out helping the community rather than sitting on the couch eating potato chips. In just one hour, there can be a lot of beneficial improvements towards the community. This service can also count towards kids National Junior Honor Society and service hours for Conformation or Bar/Bat Mitzvah's. Service hours can show a lot about someone's character and I think if all students were required to do this, everyone's character would build and get better. The community as a whole would become much better. Students can learn from helping out the community and might find a passion for a particular service. Others will realize that all these students are really trying to make a nicer community and then the other's will feel obligated to help out too. It takes a special person to really be dedicated to community service. The students will learn more about themselves and what they can do that will really help out society. If students start making positive attributes to the community you might see less crimes going around. This will also lead to students making better decisions and seeing themselves as a different person. Students will be honored by their community and should realize how much you put into to your community is how much your community will give back.

"Home schooling, also known as home education, is the education of children at home, it is usally conducted by a parent, tutor, or an online teacher. Many families use less formal ways of home school in North America, whereas ""home education"" is only used elsewhere. Before the introduction to compulsory, school attendance laws most education was done at home. Homeschooling can affect social life. Attending public schools all your life you know a lot of people. So I think homeschooling can cause depression or cause anybody who tries home education to be lonely.

In many states home education goes on as an alternative to public and private schools. In other nations home schooling is illegal so students have no choice but to attend public or private schools. In the legal states students can be home schooling for many reasons. Some reasons can be like parents not wanting their kids around others while learning. Other reasons can be dealing with being kicked out of school and no other schools will accept you because of behavior. In my society today I know a few people that have been kicked out school and forced to be home schooled online.

Being kicked out of school can be good or bad. It can be good for students that don't learn well at school, but bad for those who learn well in school. If kicked out others may need more help and start to cheat on the work and look up answers. Causing them not learn as much as they did back in public schools. So if students know they wouldn't be able to learn well with a online teacher they shouldn't do anything to get kicked out school.

I think some students fit in the classroom and others need more help like hands on or close up. Disabilities could cause a student to seek help in person with a certified teacher. Not everyone learns the same way so not just everybody can attend classes from home. Everybody learns in their own way.

Overall I think home schooling is a good thing. It can prevent school fights. Also prevent skipping and being late to school missing insructional time. If I had the choice to home school I would do it. I feel it is a great choice to make. Therefore my stance on this prompt is home school or online classes.             ";0
"No matter how hard life may become, or how much it seems like you have been mastered in something, it is important to remember that it’s important to never give up. The people that do give up end up regretting it, while those who keep persevering can achieve the success they always wanted. 

Take the example of YouTube star, Pewdiepie, for example. Before his stardom, Pewdiepie felt like he had been defeated by the world. His attempts at pursuing a higher education were thwarted, and he felt he had nowhere to go with his life. But Pewdiepie refused to give up. Instead, he pooled his resources to start his own YouTube channel, and went to work. Through hard work, dedication, and a commitment to staying true to himself, he has since become the most subscribed YouTube channel in the world, amassing 86 million subscribers.

Another example of why people should not give up even when they feel they can’t go on lies in the inspiring story of Jim Carrey. Before achieving fame, Carrey was living in poverty. He could be found sleeping in his van or sending messages to casting agents at night. He didn’t allow his older circumstance to dictate his own future. In the end, Carrey became one of the most successful and acclaimed actors of all time.

These inspiring stories show that no matter how dire a situation may seem, it is important to never give up. People who have the courage to keep going, no matter what, are always able to reach great successes that they couldn’t have imagined reaching before. So, keep pushing through and tackling life head on. You never know what amazing opportunities and successes might be waiting for you in the future.";1
We should be allowed to have cell phones at school during the free periods. We should get to have them when ever we like and we should be allowed to have them on during class as long as they are on silent or something as long as the teacher doesn't hear them on and doesn't see them out. People take phones out when they are at lunch or something when we not in class or around a lot of teachers. So we should be allowed to have them because we need to use them when parents or friends need to find us if we're not around or can't see them outside waiting for us. And if teachers can have phones out during class or at free time we should to. Just to be fair for everyone. But for the people who don't have phones if there friends say then they should be able to use them as well. So I think it a good idea to have cell phones out during the free times and at lunch so we can still talk to friends that are not in the same classes or lunch times as us. But if we can't have cell phones at school then we wouldn't know when the parents are picking us up or if they or coming to get us right after school is out and sometimes people need them to text there parents to see if friends can come over or if they can go home with there friends.;0
"Imagine, you are a student stuck doing a required assignment you truly dislike;summer break is almost over and you don't have the motivation to complete it because schoolwork feels like a chore. The information your teacher discussed in class left as soon as the last bell rang in June, so you're also clueless. You might shrug it off until the last moment or just not do it at all.

To avoid this dilemma, schools that require students to complete Summer assignments should give students the freedom to design the project themselves. If students are truly passionate about their work, they would be more likely to complete the assignment. This way students maintain the information they obtained in class and have an outlet to express their creative side. This may also benefit students who cannot learn in a classroom setting due to severe anxiety or other mental illnesses and are confused for the next year. It can be hard reteaching yourself something but not if you put your heart into it and design a project to fit your academic needs.

Teacher's may argue that students will choose an easier route and not challenge themselves. They will also argue they worry that the students wont be creative. To avoid this teachers should create a rubric that the students must follow. This allows the teacher to grade the project on effort, creativity and neatness but also allowing the student to do what they please with the assignment. They may also fear that students might be inappropriate with their designs. However, teachers can discipline them by reporting them or writing them up.

Education is important and Summer projects can be tough. Especially if you're in no school mode already. If students are able to design their own projects they can reteach themselves what they might have forgot over Summer break. Not everyone learns the same so this would give students an opportunity to expand their minds. ";0
"Many schools around the country assign summer projects for their students in order to make sure that the education of the students does not stop during the breaks. Summer assignments can also be a good way the teacher can get their students to get familiarized with the course work for the following year. In fact, more than 80% of high school AP classes give out summer projects. The summer projects assigned by some schools to their students should be teacher designed, reminding us that teachers are in control of their students' learning experience in and out of the classroom.

The teachers should design the assignments because they are the only ones that know what is going to be taught in the class. This way, the teachers can give their students the right amount of prior exposure to the contents of the course before the school year starts. Many of my teachers this year used this tactic. Specifically, my chemistry teacher gave out a project that was due on the last day of the summer break. The project was to read about the history of the periodic table, how it was formed, and how elements and compounds are named; then, we had to answer some questions made by the teacher about what we had just learned. The motive behind giving students this assignment was so that the students would get acclimated to the elements and how to use them. This helped not only students but teachers as well. Teachers often spend many classes building a base of information on a certain topic before they begin the true course work. Summer assignments are a way that teachers can bypass this and save precious class time for the true coursework. An AP Calculus AB teacher in my school did that this year in their class for the first time. They assigned a project that made students use skills they learned in Math Analysis, the preceding course, and strengthened them for use in Calculus AB. This ensured that the students now had a good base of the necessary skills, students had prior knowledge, and she did not have to spend some extra classes reviewing those skills. The teachers were able to help all parties involved by designing a summer project for their students based on what the students would learn in the class.

The teachers should design the assignments because they are the ones that grade them. Since the teachers are who the summer assignments are graded by, they should be able to design the assignment so that it meets their grading criteria. The summer project that the AP US History teachers designed for their students had a criteria included with the directions so that the students would complete the work that was expected of them by their teachers. This way the teachers received a final product that was enough to give students a satisfactory grade for their work. According to a scholarly article on the

New York Times , students received a better grade, on average, on teacher designed work than an autonomous student designed projects. The article summarized a study that showed that students better grades of assignments that required them to reach a certain criteria than assignments that gave the full autonomy on the assignment. It can be predicted that this was the case because it is easier to grade for the teachers and create a project for the students when they know exactly what the teacher wants and expects. When teachers set a criteria for summer assignments, they can control quality and quantity of the information that the students soak in.

Summer assignments can be designed by the teachers in a way to ensure that the teachers can learn about their students and their skill sets prior to the start of the class. When the teachers know more about the students, it can make the experience of the students and teachers more pleasant. My English teacher in grade eight made her students write two paragraphs about themselves as a part of their summer assignment. Then, she was able to use a more personalized way to teaching when students did not understand a certain topic. She did this because, by her experience, it is easier for students to learn about a topic when it relates to them. This was part of the reason she was one of the more successful teachers in the schools in terms of grades and standardized test scores. Teachers can also use the summer assignments to get a gauge at the level of comfort of the students with the course material before the course starts. My Algebra 2 teacher shared with her class that she gives out summer assignments so that she can see how much her students know the concepts. By doing this she was able to see the level her students were at with their knowledge, and she planned some classes to spend extra time on those concepts to help strengthen that knowledge. The teachers used their summer assignments they designed to help them better the learning of their students.

To conclude, summer projects are something that many teachers use to their advantage for the students. This is important to students because the teachers design the project to ensure they get information about their students to make their students more successful in the class. Teachers can use the summer project to expose students to the course, make sure that the student understands the sort of work that will be expected in the class, and learn about the students themselves. That is why teacher designed summer projects are essential before school starts each year.";0
"Well to start with ,they need to keep the most popular one by elections because it would be fair to people to have the electoral votes. its absoutly a great idea in my presice ! i think that people should vote on what they want to do not the senate or house of the united states . Also , it seems to me that the votes keep going down because people dont like the way they have to vote its going astronomical they need to take control NOW ! Even though candidates might now want to spend time going through the head ache of focusing on because to me its the most baic level and it UNFAIR to all voters all around the globe . Allthough my opinion is people need to realize to some of the overruled voters are all not electoral college dont mean you cannot vote for regular its entirely inpossible for the ""new president"" not to win and thats one reason why people pick that source because they know for a fact that they wll win their president they voted for this on coming ""election"" . ALL votes go to the house / state senate and it goes uphill from there so according to the passage all the electroal college requires a presidental candidate to have a regional appeal . But in 2012 President Barak Obama almost didnt make president until they put the electroal votes all together and we won PRESIDENT !! But of course knowing your vote you need to have to pay attition to the camapaign that the presidentcy were picked by a popular more VOTE . Even though votes swing on a national election one and a half americans express a petherance than a acual single vote which is probalbly much faster and easier on us and the senate. Knowing that people want to make sure our country stays in place they vote the correct presdient for the next four years so make the correct descision.    ";0
"Technology has revolutionized the way we live our lives. From smartphones to social media, technology has become an integral part of our daily routines. While technology has brought numerous benefits, it has also had a significant impact on people's health, personal relationships, and professional success. In this essay, I will explore both the positive and negative effects of technology on people's lives and provide recommendations on how to use technology responsibly.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is the way it has transformed communication. Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, have made it possible for people to connect with friends and family from all over the world. These platforms have also provided a platform for people to share their ideas and opinions, which can lead to important conversations and the exchange of knowledge.

However, technology has also had a negative impact on people's health. Excessive use of technology, such as smartphones and computers, can lead to eye strain, headaches, and poor posture. Additionally, technology has been linked to increased levels of stress and anxiety, as people may feel the need to constantly check their emails and social media notifications.

Another area where technology has had a significant impact is personal relationships. While technology has made it easier for people to connect with others, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions. People may become more isolated as they spend more time interacting with technology rather than with others.

In terms of professional success, technology has brought about many changes. For example, remote work has become more common, allowing people to work from home or from different parts of the world. However, technology has also led to increased competition, as companies can now easily find and hire talent from all over the world.

To use technology responsibly, it is important to set boundaries. This can include limiting the amount of time spent on technology each day, taking breaks to stretch and move around, and setting aside specific times to check emails and social media notifications. Additionally, it is important to prioritize face-to-face interactions and to use technology as a tool to enhance communication and collaboration rather than as a replacement for it.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives, both positive and negative. While technology has brought about numerous benefits, it has also led to a decline in certain aspects of people's health, personal relationships, and";1

"In this article the author talks about how NASA took pictures in 1976 of a rock formation on Mars that happened to look like a face. In the article they bring up reasons to believe that is is a natural rock formation instead of an alien, yet there are still people who believe that it is an alien.

In the article when the author starts talking about the Face on Mars they give many reasons as to why the Face is a natural landform. One way you know that the Face is a natural landform is because 18 years after the original picture was taken NASA went back and took newer pictures that showed that it looked as if it was just a big boulder on Mars. In the article it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.... revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that the Face was just one or a couple of years, but it went away and is now shown as a flat rock surface. Another way you know that it is a natural landform is because in the article it says that when the original NASA picture was taken they captioned it saying that it was a rock formation. In the article it says, ""NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face....A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head'."" This explains that even though the people at NASA also thought that it looked like a face they still said that it was just a rock formation that happened to look like a human face.

There are many more reason to believe that the Face is a natural landform and there are really no reasons why someone should believe that the Face is still on Mars, but we aren't getting good enough pictures. In the article it mentions a lot that the Face on Mar is just a landform and that even though people have come to believe that it was an alien they really should believe that it is a landform because there are so many more reasons to belive that.";0
"The Electoral College was a system thought up by people who lived in a time much different than our own. And in that time, it made sense. It made sure that those who cast their state's votes for president, the electors, were well informed on the issues and the stance of the candidates for those issues. However, now that everyone has access to a wealth of information through the internet, newspapers and television, this is no longer a problem; this is why election by popular vote would be a better system.

With the Electoral College, voters don't have a direct say on who becomes president. They have to trust their votes in the hands of people they don't even know. People who could cast their state's votes for any candidate they want. This system is completely unnecessary now that citizens have a wealth of information about the candidates and their stance on certain topics.

If our nation switched to election by popular vote, everyone's vote would matter. In the Electoral College system, many people in states that are decisively one way or the other, don't vote, knowing that the overwhelming majority of the population of their state is against them. This makes certain people, like Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California, feel that their vote has no power. In an election by popular vote however, every vote matters because the people's votes directly decide the president.

Our Founding Fathers were geniuses to have come up with a system that worked so well in their time, however, old methods don't always stand the test of time. Election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world.  The Electoral College eliminates the power of some people's votes and puts those that matter in the hands of people who could do whatever they want with them. This is why election by popular vote would be a better system for determining the president than the Electoral College.    ";0
"Boom! Your teacher just asked how you are feeling and you smile and say ""I'm just fine.""

Then your computer reads the way your muscles moved while talking to your teacher and realizes that your are bored and not interested. So the software in your computer can tell how you feel. A professer from the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the Universit of Illinois has created a software that can read your emotions. The way the software can do this is by seeing how the muscles in your face move. This would be very useful in a class room setting, lets see why.

In the painting of the Mona Lisa the software said she was 83 percent happy, this is judged by her eyes and the form of her smile. The software would help in a class room setting by letting the teacher know that the students are bored or not paying attention. This could also allow the teacher to get those students who aren't paying attention involved. The value of this is unmatchable and could help in a multitude of ways.

The way the software works is by seeing how each individual muscle moves and where it moves too. For example if you move your lips up and make your eyes squint the software will reconigize a smile, which would indicate happiness. A normal at home PC could not run this software, although the researchers are trying to make it a more condensed process.

So the software could be helpful inside of a classroom setting and could help keep students on task and allow teacher to know when the students are not on task. Many problems could be solved with this software. Dr. Huang has made a big impact on the side of emotional feelings and being able to judge if somebody is happy or sad,";0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

One Small Act of Kindness Can Change Everything

Have you ever noticed how one small act of kindness can have a huge impact on someone's life? Like, really huge. Like, it can change their whole day, their whole week, even their whole year. It's crazy, right? But it's true.

I know this because I've seen it happen before. Like, last week, my friend Sarah was feeling really down because she had just moved to a new town and didn't know anyone. So, I invited her to hang out with me and my friends after school. It was just a small thing, but it made her feel so much better. She was smiling and laughing and having fun, and it was amazing to see.

But it doesn't just have to be big things. Like, you can even just give someone a compliment or hold the door open for them. It's tiny, but it can make their day so much brighter. And it's not just them, it can also make you feel good too. Like, when you do something nice for someone else, it can make you feel happy and fulfilled.

And it's not just people, it can also be animals. Like, my dog, Max, he's always so happy when I give him treats or play with him. It's like, he knows I'm being nice to him, and he's so grateful. It's adorable.

So, the next time you're thinking about what to do, just remember, one small act of kindness can go a long way. It can change someone's day, their week, their life. And who knows, it might even change yours too.

In conclusion, being kind to others is super important, and it doesn't have to be a big deal. Just do something nice for someone else, and you'll see the impact it can have. It's like, it's a win-win situation. You help someone else, and you also feel good too. So, go ahead, be kind to someone today, and see what happens!";1
"As technology and digital devices improve, more and more schools have begun to utilize them by offering the option to take a class at home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to have an empty slot in their class schedule which results in students being able to come to school late or leave school early. Allowing students to take their classes by way of online or video conferencing would not be beneficial because students would be able to cheat more easily, it would be harder to communicate with teachers, and students would get more distracted in online classes than they would in school classes.

While the internet can provide long distance communication for a student to attend an online class, the internet can also provide the answers to assignments and work that the student may be assigned. If a student is allowed to take a class solely online, they will be inclined to cheat and look up answers. One counter argument that people have is that teachers have a way of seeing how many tabs are opened on the computer, but even if the teacher could see how many tabs were opened, the student could still use their phone or another digital device to look up answers. An online class would also make it easier to cheat because since the assignments would be all digital, students could utilize the copy and paste keys to look up answers quicker. If the student was taking the class at school instead, they could be given paper assignments and it would be harder for them to cheat. Online classes also make it easier for students to collaborate on assignments that they should be doing independently. Students could be using other students' help or they could be using previous students' work and it would be harder to identify.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because it would be harder to communicate with teachers. Some online classes may be taught by teachers who don't teach at the actual school the student attends. This makes it harder for students to ask them questions or ask for their help when they need it. This could cause students to not understand the topic completely and it might reflect in their grades. Online classes also make it harder for the student to build a relationship with the teacher. Because it is an online class, the student and the teacher don't really get to know each other and this could cause their relationship to be very weak. If the student was taking the in school class, they would have a stronger relationship with their teacher because the student would get to physically see and talk to the teacher every other day. The better the relationship between the teacher and the student is, the more likely it is for the student to go to the teacher and ask for help. Because the online teacher and student are not able to build a good relationship, the student might not ask questions to the teacher even if they don't understand the topic.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because students would be able to become distracted easier. Because the online class is done through video, teachers can not verify that there are no distractions present for the student. If the student was taking the class in school, the teacher would be able to see most distractions and could take them away. During an online class, the student could be able to use their phone away from the camera and the teacher would not know. This can cause the student to not pay attention to parts of the lesson and cause them to not understand as much as they might in an in school class. The student might have other distracting factors at home that would have been controlled at school like siblings or pets. At school you can produce a more focused environment than you could by taking an online class.

Online classes have some benefits, but have too many flaws to be beneficial to students. The flaws of cheating, lack of communication between teacher and student, and distractions make online classes an ineffective method of teaching. The system of online classes could be changed to try and make it more effective, but there are too many sacrifices made when you substitute in person teaching with online teaching. ";0
"Although, participating in a extracurricular activity like sports,yearbook, and student council, it may not be the best for everyone. Some kids prefer not to play for a basketball,soccer, or volleyball team, It's not one of their comfort zones or something that they enjoy. Everyone has thier personal opinios,and people shold be recpect that. You can't force someone to do something if they don't want to do it, they would not be enjoying their time. Kids should be doing something fun,something they can enjoy, and something they can look back on as a good memory. Thats a big part of being a part of a club or team. Therefore, I disagree with the decison that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Asthma, Asthma is a shortness of breathe or someone having trouble breathing. People with

Asthma may not be capable or comfortable playing a sport where it involves intense running or a lot of movement. Some people don't acknowledge how hard it is to be playing becasue they dont have

Asthma, and don't know the struggles of it. They would be able to play but it would be involving a risk, anything could happen. For example if someone chose to play soccer, and the coach is making them run 10 laps, they can faint or just fall on the floor due to shortness of breathe. Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

Yearbook , some people can define or express it to be as a fun,exciting, and an adventures thing to do.

Yearbooks are full of happy memorys thorughout the school year, all put into one little book. It also has pictures of teachers and students, so you can see your friends,teachers,and staff members. Sadly, not all people enjoy it, they think its boring, annoying, and a waste of time. People who like it will be putting amazing effort into it to come out beautifly, and people who dont care, their work is going to be sloppy because, they didn't put any effort into it. Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does.

When students are serving as a student council ,

they will be taking advantage of it. Most students are very immature and should not be trusted with a serious job. What I mean by immature is that they would be goofing around a lot, not focus, and would be taking it as a joke. In order to do the job right they should be needed to find someone more mature, someone that they can trust, and someone who will do the job right and someone who will take it seriously. If someone dosen't have a choice to do it, and that's their only option they wont be doing a good job. It's better to get someone who can take the job seriously,and not fool around.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principals final decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because,

Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

People who like doing yearbook will be putting amazing effort into it to come out beautifly, and people who dont care, their work is going to be sloppy because, they didn't put any effort into it. Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does. When students are serving as a student council, they will be taking advantage of it. Most students are very immature and should not be trusted with a serious job. Don't make someone do something they don't want to do, sometimes it can result in a bad way.     ";0
"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good idea because you are able to explore many new places, you are able to help people, and you can serve your service as a Seagoing Cowboy if you are drafted to the military. From the amazing experience Luke had you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It is an amazing opportunity to help people and to explore new places it also served as work if you were drafted to go to the military. Luke could help people because it was World War II in Europe and many countries were left in ruins so he had to help recover their food supplies, animals, and more. Luke also got to explore new places while being in the program he got to go to Europe and China he got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and see the Panama Canal on his way to China. When Luke was drafted but he didn't have to go to war because he served his service as a Seagoing Cowboy. This evidence proves that Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity. Although, there are many dangers to the sea during this job such as slipping and possibly falling out of the ship. However, there are many more good things than bad thisng during this job it is hard but you get to help others whle putting yourself in danger.

Based on the evidence in the passage and what Luke's experience was like the Seagoing Cowboys program is an very good opportunity. It allows you to help others in need, it also lets you serve your service in the military if your are drafted, and during it you may also get to explore several new places you have never been.";0
"Dear principal,

I am writing this letter to you regarding your idea of changing the school sports policy, I agree and disagree with what you are trying to do. Have you looked at the Pro's and Con's?

Did you consider that maybe the average C students have been having problems at home and sports is the only fun thing that they can really do? I'd like to know what you would do with this policy if every student willing to participate in school sports was a C or even possibly D student, would you leave it alone or change it?

It would be very unfair if you were to go through with your idea there are for sure students who are trying to be successful in school but do not fully understand the material that we are being taught. You're probably thinking well if sports were so important to them then they should make a better attempt with trying to understand the material being taught like going to tutorials. Well if you looked at the records you should see that there is a greater amount of students showing up.

My other point of view on your idea is that perhaps if they do care for sports so much this would be a bit of a drive for them and they would want to be on the sports team so it would be a win-win situation for both of you. You would win because you'd get to change it for what ever reason you'd like to change it; the student would win because they would be able to join the sports team and get they're grades higher as well. Of course there is no way of telling what the out come will be.

Sincerely,

"Mapping the Thoughts of Students

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" advancing technology used for recognizing human emotion is suggested for use in the classroom. By having a computer be able to register the emotions of a student and adjust the lesson accordingly using a program called Facial Action Coding System, student productivity will excel, and the stress felt by teachers will ease.

Lessons, for as long as education has existed, have been adjusted accordingly to the audience by the tutors. For instance, a teacher may observe their students leaning forward in interest of the lesson, and may continue based off of that subject. Others may see students slump in their chairs, or watch with glossy, bored eyes, and will attempt to reconnect with the class. Facial recognition is already common. ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day (Paragraph 5)."" But it is done ineffectively in the classroom due to one person teaching twenty others. A computer is unbiased, and only focuses on one body: The user. By reading and calculating the most subtle changes in one's face, beyond what the naked eye can see, a computer is able to follow ""emotion algorithms"" and change the lesson's strategy ""...like an effective human instructor (Paragraph 6)."" The lesson becomes personalized, benefiting the student greatly, as if they had their own private tutor. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (Paragraph 6)."" The student will understand quicker and learn at a greater rate than if they simply sat and listened to an adult stand at the front of the classroom.

In turn, this student productivity will drastically lower the stress and pressure a teacher will feel over their students. Teachers, more often than not, truly care if their students understand what is being taught and want to see them succeed. Teachers, however, do not have the time to focus on each student individualy. By watching a student fail, a teacher feels as if they themselves are failing. With emotion tracking classroom computers, each student has a better chance of succeeding. A student, who has mastered balancing chemical equations, will no longer have to 'start back at square one' with another student who knows nothing of math or chemistry. Students who fall behind more often will be more equal with their quicker classmates. On a whole, the class itself will be more productive, and the teacher may even be able to move on and prepare more advanced lessons. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (Paragraph 4)."" The focus the computer has on the student can be greater, and more effective, than what a single adult can provide. Teachers will feel more at ease knowing their students have the 'attention' they need for more challenging subjects.

Facial recognition is not a new concept, and has existed even before the invention of computers. Efficiency is what has been changing, and for the better. If computers, able to recognize and adapt according the user's emotions, better a student's productivity and reduce a teacher's stress, Facial Action Coding Systems are of great value in the classroom.";0
"Many schools currently assign projects over the summer to ensure students are still learning over break. There is an ongoing debate on whether said projects should be designed by teachers or students. Some say summer projects should be teacher-designed; otherwise, students wont use their full potential, will procrastinate, and won't learn anything of substance, but this is not true. Summer projects designed by students would more efficient than ones designed by teachers.

There are various reasons why student-designed are better at promoting learning during Summer. Students will have more choices of what they can learn about instead of being restricted to what a teacher assigns them for that class. This means students can research subjects ,outside of the curriculum, that they may be interested in for their project. Learning about what interests them will motivate students to work harder on their task. Students will want to put more into their project in because it's personal to them, unlike projects designed by teachers. In addition, students won't feel like their time is being wasted on something they see no benefit in. Teacher-designed projects such as research papers, posters, and presentations can be mundane and seem utterly pointless. Students will want to prioritize jobs, relaxation and their social life over a project that they don't have any interest in.

There are additional reasons as to why summer projects should be designed by students. Students will have to complete the project they made on their own free time. This will prepare them for the future, where they have to be responsible enough to set up and accomplish goals independently, without anyone demanding them to. Teachers often make projects that require students to reach very high standards. Failing to meet these standards usually results in failure of the project, which can be stressful. Student-designed projects allow students to reach their own standards, which can make Summer break less stressful. Finally, student-designed summer projects give students something to look forward to. They can be productive and learn without feeling like their summer vacation is being intruded by school work.

Projects assigned during summer break would be more beneficial when designed by students rather than teachers. This is because it causes less stress, makes the students responsible for their work, and motivates them. Those who are opposed to this state teacher-designed projects encourage critical thinking, and learning during Summer, but this is not the case. It is important to let students learn for themselves so they can prepare for the future.";0
"Some of te advantages of using cars less would be less pouilletion. Another one is it will be safer becasue less likely to hit another car or something.

"The dangers of using a phone while driving

Drivers should not be able to use their cell phones while they are driving. So many things can happen you can get in a car accident and lose your life or take someone else's life. There shouldn't be any reason to use your phone in the first place, your eyes should focus on the road only. Driving is no joke you have to worry about everyone around you. It is the person's job who is behind the wheel to make sure everything is safe. Driving itself is a dangerous thing to do and using a phone as well is not a smart thing to do. Cell phones can make you not focus on what's around you when you are in the vehicle.

Cell phone use while operating a vehicle has became a leading cause of car crashes over two decades. Using cell phones increases the drivers risk of causing a car crash drivers attend to get distracted while picking up the phone. Awareness is key when on the road drivers who don't have awareness leads to accidents. The police can pull you over if they see you using a cell Phone there can be some serious consequences if a police officer pulls you over. It is almost common for someone to crash while they are on their phone. The only time you can use your phone is if you got into an accident or when you get out the vehicle to go somewhere.

Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is mostly considered dangerous due to distracted driving and crashes. Voice calling can also cause accidents because the person is focused on talking to the person instead of focusing on driving. People should just stop using their phones 24-7 and just put the phone down. A phone call can always wait until you reach your destination or when you get out of the vehicle. You don't want to get a ticket over being on your cell phone because cops are always watching to see if you are on a phone.

So next time when you get inside a vehicle you should not use a cell phone it is dangers and dumb. If you get a phone call just wait until you are safe or when you are away from others so you wont make them be in danger. Your life is worth more than just a phone call we have lost way to many people over this and it's time to make a change.         ";0
"I along with other students, hate summer projects especially when a teacher designs it. As you can already tell i'm against teacher designed projects, and here is why.

When a teacher designs a summer project or any project in that matter it can be very uninteresting, which increases the chance that a student would just forget about the project or put in a low effort. Teachers these days give out more online work than paper, and anything online can be easily forgotten. Due to the fact that its online means that students would have to stay inside and not do what they've planned for the summer. Some students work efficiently if its on paper rather than a computer. What i'm trying to say here is that summer projects should not be designed by teachers.

A big reason why students should be the designers is because that teachers lack something the fresh minds of young students have. That something is creativity, believe it or not creativity can get you far in life and it even makes school work a lot easier and fun. Doing anything in the same old fashioned traditional way can be tiresome and repetitive ,but doing work or anything can be a lot more enjoyable and easy if you think of a creative way to do it. There is no reason at all a student should not be able to complete a project they designed themselves.

Now I know some people think teacher designed summer projects are more direct and easy to follow this is false because if you make the project you know all the steps and how to follow them.

In conclusion students should be the ones designing summer projects not teachers.";0
"Picking up trash will be good for the community and our school it will make the school look cleaner and healthier. I think students should be required to pick up trash so that they can see what people are doing and why it is wrong to litter. I know it will take some time to clean up our school and community but it is well worth it. If people and kids keep littering the world will not be safe for us to live in and many people might get very sick and even die!

Cleaning up the community is good because it will allow more people to move in our neighborhood and that means that it will be more families with kids and we get to hang out with them. Another good reason for picking up trash is because some people might come and visit our community and might not want to come back and visit it again. I would like them to go back home and tell their friends and family that Columbus is a great place to visit. I think if kids get caught throwing trash on the floor they should pick it up and pick up the rest of trash outside at our school.

Helping kids will be good for the community by helping the younger kids by passing the test to get on to the next grade, and so that they will not struggle in the next grade. It will provide the kids to get good grades and make there parents, teachers, and their school happy. So if I was the principal I would choose to make all students help out their community.

It could really help us in the future because we are the future kids of America and we choose what is the better America is going to look like in the future! So please let the kids do community service work by picking up trash and helping other kids and other people.

"Have you ever thought about the future? What it be like to go in your driverless car from your floating house on the top of a volcanoe. I have and I got to say I think its going to be great, but along with the consequences of it. I do have a couple reasons on why everyday that when we shape into what would be our future, we are also bringing along the little chaos. What came to mind is that i think driverless cars are gonna be a trajedy, instead of being the next best thing.

I start to see that when driverless cars come out everyones going to want them, but whats the price with this? I and i'm sure many other people think would we even need a lisence for this car and is it going to be safe as it sounds? I'm thinking that a sensor goes down and the malfunctions of the car happens its going to cause the death of many, many people to come. That people are gonna get lazy and the knowledge of even driving a car will be forgotten because these driverless cars, if it is ever possible.

Most people, ir some, find ways to make life easier on them and one of it is to be lazy, do the easiest job, or have the most fun while they can. The technology we have today transpires into something even bigger the next day, leaving remenents of the old/past behind. The stuff your grandpa and grandma had when they were kids, young teens, or young adults you'd be shocked because you would wonder ""You guys had that??"" Like its a big surprise how what they had is now forgotten.

Everyday that goes by we're forming the new furtue, but also destropying it. Driverless cars are the start and soon machines are gonna take peoples jobs. Taxi drivers are gonna be extinct because people have their own ""taxi"" to get to everywhere with. Who is to blame if a wreck happens, the driver or the manufacturer. I wouldnt be surprised if it be both.

All i'm saying is that if we do get so far ahead of ourselves with technology whats going to happen to us? I'm not talking about extinction, but i mean our surroundings and how it could effect us in a way. those are my reasons on why we SHOULDN'T produce these cars.   ";0
"You may have thought the Face was created by aliens. It could be a possibility, but think of the research and observations of the scientists. You can't just predict something and think of a conclusion. You must go through a process of research and examinations. The scientists researched and examined the Face and was just another Martian mesa that was around Cydonia.

First of all, the image did have characteristics of a face. The text stated ""a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation..which resembles a human head....formed by shawdos giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" The Face could simply have been the shadow of something or the lighting that caused it to look that way. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" The photograph from the Viking could have been a worse quality than now.

Secondly, the photograph that was captured in 1998 is more reliable and more efficient than the other one. This picture has a more clear view and is better to observe. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing....a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The landform could have been created from erosion or weathering or even different types of weather or climate. In fact, maybe a closer view could have looked a different shape.

Furthermore, there was another shot taken in 2001. With an even better camera quality, which showed different types of shapes or objects, other than a face. In the text it said ""On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.""

Garvin stated ""We had to roll the spacecrafts 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The pixels having a better quality made the observation even better. The camera could even make the objects 3 times bigger. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" They were trying to say that if it was created by aliens they could have been able to tell because of its texture or shape.

In conclusion, the Face was not created by aliens, it is just a natural landform. The Viking photo made it look like it was created by an alien because of its structure and the way it was formed and shaped and it was only because of the quality of the picture that made it seem like it was. With the more recent pictures and 10 times better quality made the scientists come to a conclusion that it was just a structure. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Garvin stated ""It remind me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the Face on Mars.""

"Dear Principle,

We definitely should not go through with this horrific idea. Your team sports will quickly lose many athletes and will probably not have enough players to even start. Many kids do have a C average that are excellent football, basketball, soccer, tennis, or softball players. Some kids can't help their learning skills as well as others. It definitely wouldn't be fare to the kids.

If I had to guess your schools athletic programs would not be very successful, do to the loss of players to the team. you will see your teams record, stat's, and even fan base decrease because of the loss of talent and depth in your depth chart. You will soon regret this very drastic decision if this change is made.

I don't think that I am the only one who feels this way about this decision. I myself have a C average in school, and I try very hard to maintain that so I can play football and basketball. Please Sir, just think about your decision. I and the whole Student Body ask of you to not change the average.

"Sure, here's my essay response:

Attending school in person has its perks, but online learning has become a game-changer in recent years. While some people argue that in-person learning is the only way to go, I believe that online learning offers a unique set of benefits that make it just as valuable.

First and foremost, attending school in person allows you to build strong relationships with your peers and teachers. You can connect with them on a personal level, ask questions, and get help when you need it. You can also learn from their experiences and perspectives, which can broaden your horizons and help you grow as a person. In contrast, online learning can be more isolating, as you may not have as much opportunity to interact with your classmates or instructors.

However, online learning also offers some significant advantages. For one, you can access resources from anywhere, at any time. This means you can learn at your own pace, and you don't have to worry about missing out on important information just because you were absent from class. You can also save money on materials, as you don't have to buy textbooks or other supplies. Plus, online learning allows you to gain insights from multiple perspectives, as you can access resources from all over the world.

Another benefit of online learning is that it can be more flexible. You can take classes from the comfort of your own home, or even on the go. This can be especially helpful for people who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where access to education is limited.

Of course, there are also some challenges to online learning. For one, it can be difficult to connect with your classmates and instructors. You may not have as much opportunity to ask questions or get help when you need it. Additionally, online learning can lack the hands-on activities that are so important for learning certain subjects, like science or math. And while online learning can offer a more personalized experience, it can also be more impersonal, as you may not have as much face-to-face interaction with your instructors.

In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to attending school in person, I believe that online learning offers a unique set of advantages that make it just as valuable. With the right resources and support, online";1

"Dear state senator, I believe that election by popular vote for the president of the united states is the smartest and easiest way to go about things. There are many people who believe that it is the better way to go about things given that the electoral college is a waste of time or so some may say. Over sixty percent of voters back in two-thousand would have perferred a direct election instead of voting to a bunch of electors. I mean would you rather vote for one person or vote for twenty-six.

The electoral college is a place that the founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting, where they vote for president and vice president, and counting the electoral votes by congress. The college consists of five hundred-thirty eight electors and a majority of two hundred-seventy votes is required for the election of a president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Under the electoral college the people vote not for the president, but for the slate of elector, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college is unfair to the voters because of the winner-take-all system. During the two-thousand campaign, seventeen states didnt see candidates at all. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all have the same thing in common, they want to abolish the electoral college. Some electors even have the nerve to occasionally refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

So i hope that explained alot on how the electoral college is not a good way to vote. That way is to long and people might not get filled in on what happened or who won or there vote might even get changed. One of these days the electoral college will be gone and it will just be the president winning by having more votes. We dont need all that confusing way of voting just a simple vote and the winner is the one with the most votes.    ";0
